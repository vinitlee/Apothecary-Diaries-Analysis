Emperor birth time range: The current bounds on the age of the [[Emperor]] come from [[Jinshi]] saying that he was born "ten-odd" years after the [[Emperor]] and the fact that the [[Emperor]] got [[Ah-Duo]] pregnant at the same time. It seems unlikely that she was pregnant at 10, but also unlikely that she was over 20. ^8451ca
