Emperor birth time range: The current bounds on the age of the [[Emperor]] come from [[Jinshi]] saying that he was born "ten-odd" years after the [[Emperor]] and the fact that the [[Emperor]] got [[Ah-Duo]] pregnant at the same time. It seems unlikely that she was pregnant at 10, but also unlikely that she was over 20. ^8451ca

This is something to check using early S01.  I think this should be able to be told within a few months. We know that the assassination happens only a few days before the second Garden Party, we should be able to tell the season at the start of S01E01, and I believe there was an explicit period of time skipped between the kidnapping and the true start of the series.^9a91ad

Okay, some notes from the manga
Apparently, at the time of expulsion, [[Jinshi]] is 17. This is confirmed from [[Maomao]]'s research in the archives while investigating [[Fengming]] at the [[Garnet Pavilion]], when she reads that [[Ah-Duo Pregnancy]] delivery was 17 years ago.
The baby (in her care) died a year later.
[[Ah-Duo]] is 35 and the [[Emperor]] is 34 at time of investigation.
This requires updating of all events that relied on [[Jinshi]] being 19, but also might be best to revise everything to be relative to date of kidnapping.
# Episode Timeline
Most increments here are approximate because the show is not explicit about whether something is happening the next day, a few days later, or a few weeks later. When the day delta is a guess, it will have a **?** appended. When it is strongly explicit, it will have a **!** appended. When there is nothing appended, it is not explicit but is a solid inference.
