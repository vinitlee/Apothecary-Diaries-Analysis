Emperor birth time range: The current bounds on the age of the [[Emperor]] come from [[Jinshi]] saying that he was born "ten-odd" years after the [[Emperor]] and the fact that the [[Emperor]] got [[Ah-Duo]] pregnant at the same time. It seems unlikely that she was pregnant at 10, but also unlikely that she was over 20. ^8451ca

This is something to check using early S01.  I think this should be able to be told within a few months. We know that the assassination happens only a few days before the second Garden Party, we should be able to tell the season at the start of S01E01, and I believe there was an explicit period of time skipped between the kidnapping and the true start of the series.^9a91ad
