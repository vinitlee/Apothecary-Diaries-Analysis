	- The current manager was poisoned by his brother under advisement from a mystery man with blue eyes [[S01E15 - Raw Fish]]
		- This could be Suirei, but it's unclear. Their eyes are the same color, but the man is drawn with a more masculine face than Suirei is
		- It's also unclear if there is a connection to the 10 year old case
		- Timeline is a little unclear, but it is likely that the poisoning happened shortly before the warehouse fire. On the day that Gaoshun tells Maomao about the poisoning, it had been a few days since the fire and around a week since the poisoning.
