I have discovered that these (dark lines) are walkways, not walls. Maybe. They also might just be bs.

The gazebo near the top cutting into the lake is where [[Gyokuyou]] and [[Jinshi]] have tea in [[S02E27 - Corpse Fungus]]

This is the circled location for the school. It's suggested that the circled area is called "the southern courtyard" and is near the main gate. It's also a common congregating place.

This is called out to be the north side near the [[North ruins]]

Steam house is built on pavilion side of the rear courtyard

[[Maomao]]'s room is on the right side of main building
![[VS--Vilos-20’31”.png]]This seems to be to the west side of the [[Jade Pavilion]], even though there is a smaller washing area to the north, near the courtyard. This would be somewhat directly west of the arch-shaped rock

Southern gate of [[Jade Pavilion]]

Heading west from the south gate of [[Jade Pavilion]]
The two visible towers seem to confirm that 
![[Pasted image 20250617193025.png]]
Is the [[Jade Pavilion]]

E01 20:41 - We can see that one of the exposed sewer lines is on the W side of the laundry area and runs NS

E01 5:58 - Same hangers as seen at sunset

Note that Wisteria-9 is N of this location

This is a very similar but different gazebo

Garden where [[Jinshi]] meets [[Lihaku]]

It seems that it's near the barracks/training grounds

Jinshi's main residence is in the outer palace, at the south side of the SE corner of the rear palace

Jinshi's house is to the left, which should be the west

# [[The Outer Court]]
![[Pasted image 20250617181408.png]]
Explosion located at the warehouses near the military wing. Weirdly, this seems to be located south west of the south entrance to the rear palace (seen on the left). We can tell that it's the south entrance because of the grove of trees at the south east corner. Additionally, it's unclear where the stone wall at the [[Garden Mound]] would be in this photo
![[Pasted image 20250617183223.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250617183723.png]]
Brightened shot of explosion. We can now clearly see the SE corner guard tower of the palace
![[Pasted image 20250617184216.png]]
Same shot again, this time in [[S01E15 - Raw Fish]]
![[Pasted image 20250617184338.png]]
This is suggested to be near the bottom of the road shown above, with the bend to the right side of this frame out of frame in the wide shot
![[VS--Vilos-8’32”.png]]
Another angle of that, pointing north
![[VS--Vilos-4’02”.png]]
Another angle, pointing west. It's possible that the directions or location is messed up here. This feels like the west gate of the palace.
However, it could also be the south gate, simply cutting out the rightmost tunnel. We can see that the doors on the outside are square, even though the passage is arched. The tree on the left matches 
## South Entrance
![[VS--Vilos-3’59”.png]]
Shot of south entrance
![[Pasted image 20250617200020.png]]
![[VS--Vilos-7’47”.png]]
This is directly in the south gate (see three doorways behind)
![[VS--Vilos-7’55”.png]]
This is along the path from the main entrance, which is somewhat weird
## [[The Military Wing]]
![[Pasted image 20250617181653.png]]
Walkway to [[Garden Mound]] and [[The Military Wing]]
![[Pasted image 20250617181739.png]]
The warehouses are to the left of the intersection seen beyond the circular doorway here or perhaps at the next intersection after that
![[Pasted image 20250617181946.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250617182534.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250617182725.png]]
The well is in line with the warehouses
![[VS--Vilos-19’45”.png]]
The [[Garden Mound]] is very likely at the eastern wall of the outer palace (but with some space between it and the wall)

We know that it's at the west end of the outer court
