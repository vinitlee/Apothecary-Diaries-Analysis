# Notes
[[S01E19 - Chance or Something More]]
Used to work for the [[Board of Rites]]. However, he was demoted after voicing concern that the pillar which fell in [[Suirei's Plot to Kill Jinshi]] was going to fall. It is unclear who was responsible for this demotion, but they are made suspicious by the course of events. For some reason, he now does not doubt the build strength.

A less suspicious reading of these events is that he was simply involved in the construction of the [[Altar of the Sapphire Sky]] and worried about the pillar before it was functional, then changed his mind once it had been built and there had not been problems for a while. However, in the flashback in [[S01E19 - Chance or Something More|S01E19]], the Altar looks quite complete.
