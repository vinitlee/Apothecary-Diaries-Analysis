# Plot
- [[Lakan]] looking at the withered rose, [[Verdigris House]] room
	- Lakan is thinking about his desire to be with Maomao
	- He thinks that [[Fengxian]] is dead and wants to be with the person she left behind
	- We see a baby Maomao picking [[Woodsorrel]], another connection between the two
	- He feels that it's natural for [[Maomao]] to hate him, but he still wants her nearby
	- He thinks that he's failed
	- He resents that [[Jinshi]] is close to [[Maomao]]
	- [[Yarite Baba]] comes in the room and he begrudgingly says that he'll uphold his end of the deal, no matter the cost
- Picking a girl
	- He is brought into the mail hall of [[Verdigris House]]
	- A line of girls is there, with [[Meimei]] in the front
		- They all are depicted with Go pieces for faces
	- [[Yarite Baba]] says that he can have his pick
	- He questions whether she really wants to include [[Meimei]], since she is one of the [[Three Princesses]]
	- He views this all as a trouble, but he tends towards [[Meimei]], since she's been good to him
	- [[Meimei]] says that if he picks her, she'll accept without hesitation
	- However, she walks over to the side door to the [[Verdigris Annex]] and opens it up
		- We hear, faintly, the sound of [[Fengxian's Song]] coming from the [[Verdigris Annex]]
	- Lakan cannot comprehend what he is hearing
	- Then, it all comes together and he starts running like a madman straight for the sound, tripping over barriers
		- Also breaking his monocle on the way, which strips him down to more of a person than we've seen him
	- [[Yarite Baba]] protests and says that she told [[Meimei]] not to open that door
		- [[Yarite Baba]] is still protective of [[Fengxian]]
	- [[Lakan]] realizes the meaning of the withered rose
- [[Verdigris Annex]]
	- [[Fengxian]] is singing at the window
	- [[Lakan]] makes it to the room and then stands transfixed
	- [[Yarite Baba]] comes chasing after with [[Meimei]] in tow, protesting
	- [[Lakan]] says that he does need to pick
		- And that he picks her, [[Fengxian]]
		- No matter the price, he will pay it
		- [[Yarite Baba]] continues to protest, but [[Meimei]] quiets her
	- [[Lakan]] sits on the bed and takes out a bag of go pieces from his sleeve. He removes a black piece and a white piece and puts them in her hand and says "Let's play Go"
		- This is him showing that he wants to give her everything that she may want, as a reference to the last game they played, but instead of wanting to be selfish in respect to his position, he now only wants to live for her.
	- She looks at him, face sunken and diseased.
		- But we see from [[Lakan]]'s point of view, where she is beautiful and unblemished as 20 years ago
			- The flipside to his face blindness
			- Damn I need to stop cutting onions
	- [[Meimei]] breaks down crying
		- Both from the emotion of the moment but also for the time that was lost
		- She asks why [[Fengxian]] could not have been honest from the start, why it took this long
	- [[Yarite Baba]] seems to have processed what is happening and is watching on
	- [[Lakan]] reaffirms that he will buy this courtesan
- Back in the palace
	- [[Maomao]] and [[Basen]] are returning from the carriage ride from [[Verdigris House]]
	- [[Basen]] spots [[Loulan]] and [[Master Shishou]] at a gate
		- He does not seem to like them
		- He calls them "the wicked father-daughter duo"
		- [[Loulan]] has three ladies in waiting behind her
		- [[Master Shishou]] has four men behind him
	- "My Hometown" plays as background music
	- This may not be in the [[Rear Palace]], since [[Maomao]] comments that they stayed out after the Garden Party
	- [[Maomao]] reflects that [[Master Shishou]] pushed hard to get his daughter in the [[Rear Palace]]
	- [[Maomao]] concerned about [[Basen]] badmouthing high-up officials, since it might cause her trouble
	- [[Basen]] tells her that [[Jinshi]] wants to see her
- [[Jinshi]]'s room
	- [[Jinshi]], [[Gaoshun]], and [[Suiren]] are there
	- [[Suiren]] is worried about [[Maomao]], much more doting than she typically is
	- [[Jinshi]] questions [[Maomao]] because he thought she hated [[Lakan]]
		- She jokes that she's here because he "landed that shot"
	- [[Maomao]] gives more agency to [[Fengxian]], and, [[S01E18 - Lakan#^d2102c|similar to the line in S01E18 by Meimei]], implies that [[Fengxian]] was trying to game the system and lost her mind when her master plan did not work out
		- She likely timed it so he visited when she was most fertile
	- [[Maomao]] explains [[Lakan]]'s face blindness and explains that he can see her face, thus the attachment
		- She also has inferred that [[Lakan]] always talks to [[Jinshi]] in his office because of the face blindness
	- She dislikes [[Lakan]], but does not hate him
	- [[Maomao]] explains why [[Lakan]] has been at crucial points uncovering [[Suirei's Plot to Kill Jinshi]]. He does not collect evidence like she does, but goes with his gut and is rarely wrong. He did not know what was going to happen, but the traps that [[Suirei]] set stood out to him and so he pushed pieces around to uncover them.
		- She notes that he is too lazy to take action himself, contributing to the partial failure of her operation
		- She both thinks very highly of [[Lakan]]'s abilities and very low of his character, describing the feeling as jealousy
			- He's talented enough to receive [[Luomen]]'s praise without caveat
	- [[Lakan]] will not become an ally, but may be help as a non-enemy
	- [[Gaoshun]] tries to remind her that no father *wants* to be disliked
		- Is there any connection we're supposed to be drawing to [[Loulan]]/[[Master Shishou]]?
- Letter from [[Meimei]]
	- Informs Maomao of [[Lakan]]/[[Fengxian]]
	- Includes a beautiful silk shawl and a note that says that [[Meimei]] wants her to dance when she gets bought off
	- History aside, [[Maomao]] feels that [[Meimei]] deserves happiness and wanted to send her off
- Dance sequence
	- This is the custom to send off a courtesan who has been bought off
	- It is her way of congratulating her parents on finally getting together
	- Jinshi finds her, surprises her, saves her, and scolds her
	- She explains what the dance was for
	- She recounts that [[Lakan]] paid so much for [[Fengxian]] that the celebrations are double what they usually are
		- Both shows his picture of her and to make up for the one she never had because of him
	- Maomao also recounts that the ladies of [[Verdigris House]] hid that [[Fengxian]] was her mother when she was growing up, but that she found out through leaks that [[Fengxian]] was her mother and that [[Maomao]] was the reason that [[Verdigris House]] almost went out of business once
	- She explains that the nightmare was real
	- She has a crooked finger, but tells [[Jinshi]] that fingertips grow back
	- Her leg wound from saving [[Jinshi]] opens up again and she sits down to sew it up
	- He stops her, picks her up, jumps off the wall, and carries her to the room
	- He says that this isn't he first time he's carried her like this, as a reference to the time in [[S01E19 - Chance or Something More]]
	- She trolls him be getting all romantic and then asking for the [[Ox bezoar]]
- Teaser
	- [[Maomao]] is in her room looking at her [[Cordyceps]]
	- She gets called out by [[Jinshi]] to help with something interesting
