# Plot
- [[Jinshi]] and [[Gaoshun]] discuss the [[Caravan]]
	- [[Caravan]]
		- Larger than last time ^a1b7a9
		- Is the advance party of special envoys from a foreign nation
			- [[Cousin Special Envoys]]
		- Will stay longer than usual
	- Envoy
		- [[Cousin Special Envoys]]?
		- There will be a welcome banquet
		- It is being managed by a high-ranking officer in charge of receptions ^f886db
			- Is this [[Master Shishou]]?
		- The envoy/neighboring country is important diplomatically
- Shot of a [[Thornapple]] flower, perhaps in the [[Garden Mound]]
- Lady in waiting duties
	- [[Jade Pavilion]]
	- It's becoming summer
	- [[Hongnian]] is directing the [[Jade Pavilion]] ladies in waiting
		- [[Yinghua]], [[Ailan]], and [[Maomao]] will organize outfits in anticipation of a wardrobe change
		- [[Guiyuan]] will take care of [[Lingli]]
- Organizing wardrobe
	- There are many bins of clothes
	- [[Yinghua]] comments on changing styles
		- Some are still good
		- But the ones that were very popular are now very stale
	- [[Maomao]] asks what happens to the old clothes
		- They get reworked by craftsmen
		- Sent to [[The West of Li]] as a charity
		- So [[Maomao]] is going to put in mothballs
	- [[Ailan]] mentions that there will be a new lady in waiting soon
		- Because [[Gyokuyou]] is pregnant, they will need more help
		- Because [[Loulan]] now has more than 50 ladies-in-waiting and servant girls
			- [[Crystal Pavilion]] has 30 (including servant girls)
			- [[Gyokuyou]] is the [[Emperor]]'s favorite, so this sends the wrong message
	- #shot of three women on a carriage in the caravan
		- [[Triplet 1]]
		- [[Triplet 2]]
		- [[Triplet 3]]
	- They are keeping very few of the old clothes
		- This is ok
			- They have ordered some new ones
			- Caravan is coming
	- [[Caravan]]
		- [[Maomao]] was not here the last time there was a caravan
		- This one is [[S02E26 - Caravan#^a1b7a9|bigger]] than usual
		- [[Gyokuyou]] gives them an allowance
	- [[Hongnian]] gets mad that they're chatting so much
- [[Maomao]]'s thoughts about the [[Caravan]]
	- There is not much entertainment in the [[Rear Palace]]
	- Shopping must be exciting
- [[Lihua]]
	- Stroking her belly, suggests that she is [[Lihua Pregnancy 2|pregnant]]
	- She is pouring tea for herself
	- [[Shin]] and three ladies in waiting enter and bow
		- They seem somewhat cold about it
	- [[Lihua]] hands [[Shin]] a scroll with a shopping list for the [[Caravan]]
		- [[Lihua]] asks that she hand this out to all the ladies in waiting
		- [[Shin]] says that she'll have one of the ladies in waiting handle it
			- #why does [[Lihua]] ask her to hand it out to everyone, but [[Shin]] delegates it to one person?
		- [[Lihua]] seems very kind and gentle now, but her ladies-in-waiting and [[Shin]] seem like the old [[Lihua]]
	- #shot of [[Shin]]'s lips and lower face. She has a serious expression or frown on. She is wearing pink lip makeup and we can see pink-tasseled gold flower earrings.
- [[Shin]] leaving the meeting
	- [[Shin]] is walking down the stairs from the upper level of the [[Crystal Pavilion]]
	- Her demeanor is similar to the shot of her lips.
		- She is serious
		- Severe
		- Perhaps even upset
	- A servant girl at the bottom of the steps delivers her a message from the clinic
		- The servant girl seems nervous to talk to [[Shin]], even just to deliver a message
		- She uses ～さま when referring to [[Shin]]
	- [[Shin]] seems surprised that there is a message from the clinic
		- Picks it up and reads it
	- [[Shin]]'s visage becomes **even more** severe and enveloped by harsh shadows
		- #why is [[Shin]] acting so menacingly ^0937da
- Waiting to shop at the [[Caravan]]
	- The [[Caravan]] lasts for five days
	- The [[Caravan]] strongly seems to have middle eastern influence, shown through music, dress, and motifs
	- [[Maomao]] needs to wait to shop after the concubines and the ladies-in-waiting
		- #huh [[Maomao]] refers to herself as a bottom-tier servant, but isn't she at least the level of lady-in-waiting? I don't get the impression that her position under [[Jinshi]] is a downgrade from when she was technically a lady-in-waiting for [[Gyokuyou]], so why is she saying that she is a bottom-tier servant? Also, isn't she on the hook to help with the shopping for the [[Jade Pavilion]]?
	- [[Maomao]] is watching the [[Caravan]] from afar with [[Xiaolan]]
		- [[Xiaolan]] wants new clothes and stuff
			- [[Maomao]] says that they don't have any chance to wear clothes other than their uniforms
	- [[Maomao]] considers how the [[Rear Palace]] is weird
		- Lots of people, but no shops
		- The only [[Eunuch Doctor|doctor]] is a quack
		- If disease broke out, it would likely spread uncontrollably
			- Except that sanitation is top-notch
			- Underground sewers carry out waste straight to the [[Great River]], bypassing the moat ^d8d93c
				- #whoa this would suggest that there's a way between the [[Rear Palace]] and the [[Great River]] that is not protected by the moat
				- This is technology from [[The West]]
				- This was the doing of "The Empress", aka [[Previous Empress Dowager]] ^0e6623
			- Because of the good hygiene, disease is mostly prevented
			- Those with severe illness are sent home to quarantine
				- But it seems that [[Maomao]] still feels like there's something missing from the picture
	- [[Xiaolan]] interrupts [[Maomao]]'s thoughts and asks her to go to the [[Caravan]] with her on the last day
- What the [[Jade Pavilion]] bought
	- #shot of the various goods that [[Gyokuyou]] bought from the [[Caravan]]
		- 5 Dresses with high belts
		- Gold bangles
		- Jade jewelry
		- Gold-rimmed cups
		- Temari
	- The jewelry is very on-style for [[Gyokuyou]]
	- [[Gyokuyou]] asks if she spent too much
		- [[Hongnian]] says that, if anything, she could have bought more
		- It seems that [[Gyokuyou]] is naturally restrained
	- The other [[High-ranking Concubine]]s likely bought more
		- [[Crystal Pavilion]]: Ladies-in-waiting likely went all out, plus [[Lihua]] is generous
		- [[Diamond Pavilion]]: Ladies-in-waiting likely manipulated [[Lishu]] into buying stuff for them
		- [[Garnet Pavilion]]: [[Loulan]] already seen to be flashy, likely bought lots as well
	- [[Gyokuyou]], in contrast, seems thrifty
- The dresses
	- When going to put away the haul, [[Maomao]] notices something about the dresses
	- They all have high belts tied right below the bosom
		- This is very much like maternity clothing
	- [[Maomao]] asks if all of the dresses were like this
		- Apparently there were a lot of them
		- [[Ailan]] says that she heard they were in style
	- [[Maomao]] is suspicious
		- Very few people should know about [[Gyokuyou]]'s pregnancy right now
		- However, these clothes are different from [[Gyokuyou]]'s typical style, which would have a belt around the waist
		- Instead, they feature a higher belt like would be on maternity dresses
	- [[Maomao]] suggests asking for designs with lower belts tomorrow to mask the fact that [[Gyokuyou]] is, in fact, pregnant
		- [[Gyokuyou]] and [[Hongnian]] understand, but keep the hidden goal quiet from the ladies-in-waiting
- [[Caravan]], last day
	- [[Maomao]] and [[Xiaolan]] are walking through the [[Caravan]]
	- It's just leftovers on the last day
	- [[Xiaolan]] is excited to see the wares
	- [[Maomao]] buys red hair ties for [[Xiaolan]]
	- No medicines at the [[Caravan]]
	- There are teas and spices
		- [[Clove]]
		- [[Anise]]
		- [[Sand ginger]]
		- [[Chenpi]]
	- [[Maomao]] is on the hunt for discounts because it is the last day
		- She thinks that there would typically be price gouging because of the venue
	- [[Maomao]] buys some spices
- [[Jasmine Blooming Tea]]
	- [[Maomao]] sees three bulbs of [[Jasmine Blooming Tea]]
	- [[Maomao]] and [[Shisui]] simultaneously ask for the [[Jasmine Blooming Tea]]
	- [[Shisui]] asks about [[The Cat]]
		- [[Maomao]] remembers who she is
	- [[Xiaolan]] knows [[Shisui]]
		- [[Shisui]] is wearing the same dress as [[Xiaolan]]
		- [[Maomao]] infers that [[Shisui]] works in the laundry area
	- [[Maomao]] buys three of the [[Jasmine Blooming Tea]] so they can wrap their business and not block the stall
- [[Maomao]] brings her new friend to the [[Rear Palace Medical Office]]
	- [[Eunuch Doctor]] says that he didn't expect [[Maomao]] to have friends
	- The look at the cat
		- Ask its name
	- Doctor prepares snacks
		- Mooncakes
			- #huh is this just "Chinese-y snack", or is this actually supposed to be in late July or August?
	- [[Maomao]] makes the [[Jasmine Blooming Tea]]
	- [[Xiaolan]] is wowed by the snacks
	- [[Shisui]] asks if it's always a big festival like this
		- She seems to be talking about the [[Caravan]]
		- [[Maomao]] reflects that this is [[Shisui]]'s first [[Caravan]] too.
			- She assumes that [[Shisui]] came at the same time as [[Loulan]] #why 
			- So she figures that [[Shisui]] has been in the[[Rear Palace]] for around 6 months
		- Repeated facts about the [[Caravan]]
			- Longer than usual
			- Special foreign envoys from another country are coming
	- [[Eunuch Doctor]] offers the information about the foreign envoys. [[Maomao]] is not sure that this is public information, but he just tells some servant girls. This evokes the caution she took in keeping sensitive information from him in [[S02E25 - Maomao and Maomao#^8b05d2|the last episode]].
- Weird smell
	- [[Shisui]] starts a new conversation
	- She says that there's a weird smell on the north side of the [[Rear Palace]] recently
	- The [[Eunuch Doctor]] says that the north side is "a bit of a mess"
	- He hypothesizes that a waterway might have gotten clogged
	- [[Xiaolan]] asks if [[Shisui]] has work on that side
		- She doesn't
		- But there are shrubs there that have insects in them
		- [[Shisui]] pulls out a stack of paper with drawings of grasshoppers on them
	- [[Maomao]] compliments her drawing
	- [[Shisui]] says that it's great that there are so many different bugs to draw in the [[Rear Palace]]
		- However, this is interesting. I wouldn't expect the [[Rear Palace]] to have wildlife that is that different from the surrounding area, so it's likely that [[Shisui]] is not from nearby. "Here" in "there's a lot of bugs here" starts being in the capital city rather than in the [[Rear Palace]]. Furthermore, it seems likely that she's from a place with a less hospitable climate, since if she was from the south it would be likely that there would be more bugs, not fewer.
		- [[Who is this new girl]]
	- [[Maomao]] reflects that insects can be used for medicine too
		- [[Praying mantis egg case]]
		- [[Earthworm]]
	- [[Shisui]] describes locations of insects
		- Fruit garden on south side does not have many because it is well-kept
		- Ruins on north side have lots
			- Including spiders
			- [[Maomao]] perks up
				- Wants [[Spider Silk]]
	- [[Shisui]] invites [[Maomao]] to go check out the [[North ruins]] with her
		- [[Shisui]] mentions eating insects
- At night
	- Sound of coughing
	- A person walking with a candle to a box
	- Opens the box
		- There are decorative bottles inside
		- The bottles match the style of the [[Caravan]]
- [[Scented oils]]
	- A few days after the [[Caravan]] left, [[Scented oils]] became popular in the [[Rear Palace]]
	- [[Maomao]] is working in the laundry area
		- #huh What is [[Maomao]]'s job?
	- [[Xiaolan]] is complaining that the clothes stink
	- Some clothes get dumped on [[Maomao]] on accident
	- She smells rose on a blue dress
		- Thinks about how she could sell her rose [[Scented oils]]
		- But thinks better of it because of the abortive effects
	- She sniffs another blue garment and says that the scent is on it as well
		- And then sniffs some more garments without comment
	- She runs off
		- To the [[Crystal Pavilion]]
		- [[Crystal Pavilion]] is susceptible to fads
- Sniffing at the [[Crystal Pavilion]]
	- Montage of [[Maomao]] sniffing ladies at the [[Crystal Pavilion]]
	- It seems that she doesn't find what she's looking for until she smells [[Shin]]'s dress
		- It may also just be that [[Maomao]] smells a lot on [[Shin]]
			- We learn in [[S02E29 - The Moon Fairy]] that it's actually that [[Shin]] is not wearing any
	- [[Shin]] throws her out and writes an official complaint
- [[Jinshi]] addresses the complaint
	- [[Shin]] has filed an official complaint
	- [[Maomao]] does the needed apologies, but then moves on to her reasons
	- She writes up a list of compounds
		- [[Rose]]
		- [[Benzoin]]
		- [[Parasol Tree]]
		- [[Frankincense]]
		- [[Cinnamon]]
	- They are a list of scents and oils that [[Maomao]] smelled on the ladies of the [[Crystal Pavilion]]
		- These compounds also have a negative effect on pregnancy
	- [[Maomao]] also shows spices and teas she bought at the [[Caravan]]
		- [[Jasmine Blooming Tea]]
			- Constricts uterus
		- [[Mustard]]
			- Ingredient in abortive drugs
	- She says that these are not dangerous normally, but can be used in high concentrations to negatively affect pregnancies
	- [[Maomao]] asks [[Jinshi]] to look into the vendors
		- [[Jinshi]] will
		- But they were already inspected
		- And it's unlikely that detailed records were kept
	- [[Maomao]] likens this to the first incident of the show involving [[White Face Powder]] containing [[Lead]] which killed the child of [[Lihua Pregnancy 1]] and endangered [[Lingli]]
	- [[Jinshi]] asks if they can assume that someone was trying to bring poison into the [[Rear Palace]]
		- [[Maomao]] cannot say for certain
		- There were many compounds brought in that could be used as poisons but are mundane compounds
		- The other concubines should be warned
	- [[Hongnian]] instructs [[Guiyuan]] to check the scented oils, spices, and teas in the [[Jade Pavilion]]
- [[Maomao]] recontextualizes this in the events of S01
	- [[Suirei]] still at large
	- She tried to assassinate [[Jinshi]]
	- More people than just her involved
		- The question is how embedded the conspirators are
- [[Maomao]] making [[Jasmine Blooming Tea]] in the kitchen
	- She frets over how much of this is coincidence versus planning
	- She sees the connections, but jumping to the conclusion there is a plot is premature
	- However, they cannot afford to take too many risks
	- She remembers [[Luomen]] telling her to gather proof rather than working off of conjecture
	- [[Jinshi]] comes in
		- He jokes that he thought the tea was poison
		- However
			- It's not strong enough in small doses
			- She's not pregnant
		- [[Maomao]] tells him off for being in the kitchen, which is below his station
	- [[Jinshi]] asks for tea and wants the [[Jasmine Blooming Tea]] as well
		- [[Maomao]] says it's the last one and steeping it again would make the tea watery
			- [[Jinshi]] says that's fine
			- However, [[Maomao]] starts to prepare a different tea
	- [[Jinshi]] asks what the effects of the tea are
		- Calms the mind
		- Improves sleep
		- Helps wake people up
		- Helps with giving birth
	- [[Jinshi]] comments that there are more good effects than bad
		- [[Maomao]] agrees and says that can make remembering the bad ones hard
	- [[Maomao]] finishes making white tea for [[Jinshi]]
		- He protests, saying that he wanted the watery re-brewed [[Jasmine Blooming Tea]]
	- [[Maomao]] tells him that [[Jasmine Blooming Tea]] also decreases fertility in males
		- This was a spicy joke
		- [[Jinshi]] is not amused
	- She goes to fix snacks
	- While she's not looking, he drinks the already-brewed [[Jasmine Blooming Tea]] (that she was drinking from) and then leaves
		- Since this is an anime, I'm sure this is meant to be an "indirect kiss"
		- He plays it off as if he's upset
			- It's unclear if this is a ruse or if he's actually frustrated
- [[Jinshi]] meets [[Gaoshun]]
	- Night, right after [[Jinshi]] leaves the kitchen
	- [[Gaoshun]] reports that he's delivered the message regarding the dangerous compounds
	- He also reports that [[Concubine Jin]] has died
		- Middle rank
		- Poisoned
		- [[Gaoshun]] whispers the details to [[Jinshi]]

	- Implication that the tea is poisoned
