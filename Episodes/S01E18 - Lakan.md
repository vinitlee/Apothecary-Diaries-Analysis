# Plot

- Pick up
  - Maomao has just said pregnancy would reduce it to zero
  - He wants her to stay buy she pulls away, makes an excuse, and leaves
  - She tells herself that it's fine, since she did not show emotion
    - This clues in that the story she just told is personal
- Flashes and waking up at home
  - Knife
  - Baby pinky
  - Bandaged and diseased hand
  - Baby crying
  - Knife comes down
  - Maomao wakes up
    - Breathing hard
    - States it's a memory from when she was a baby
    - Says it's because she talked about "it" with Jinshi
  - Luomen serves rice porridge for breakfast
    - Simple lifestyle
  - Asks her to go to the Verdigris house
- Verdigris House
  - Maomao dropping things off for Luomen
  - Pairin greets her
    - There is a bidding war for Pairin going on, but she's putting it off
- Verdigris Annex
  - Introduction of modern-day [[Fengxian]]
  - Same diseased skin as in the dream
  - Matching hair to Maomao's
  - But we also know that this someone who used to be the top courtesan and knew Lakan
  - And we also believe that Lakan got her pregnant and tanked her value
  - Meanwhile, Lakan arrives at the main house
    - Granny fetches Meimei
  - Apparently, Fengxian served tea during a rough time for Verdigris House and caught syphilis during that period
  - When Luomen came to the house, the illness was in incubation
    - He just appeared one day
    - The courtesans were not forthcoming, otherwise he may have been able to do something
  - When the disease started to manifest, she was locked in the annex
    - This is very generous, since the expectation would be that she would be abandoned
  - Maomao opens the windows
  - Fengxian starts to hum a [[Fengxian's Song|song]]
  - A young employee of Verdigris House lets Maomao know that Lakan has arrived and that she should stay hidden
    - Maomao responds as if this is a regular occurrence
  - Fengxian starts laying out rocks on her bed in the style of Go
- After Lakan has left
  - It's sunset, and Maomao has run out of things to do
  - Meimei comes in and lets Maomao know that Lakan is gone
  - Meimei has been sitting with him
  - Meimei referrs to Fengxian as Big Sis and seems to care about her wellbeing
  - Meimei says that Maomao is getting _that_ offer again
    - Probably referring to Lakan wanting to buy out Maomao?
      - But how would that work, since she has been bought out by Jinshi?
  - While Maomao complains about the situation with Lakan looking to buy her out, Meimei has a different point of view. She says that it's not such a bad deal, since it's rare for a courtesan to get everything they want.
    - This is a surprisingly multi-layered line
      - Direct: Meimei's view of Maomao/Lakan
      - Sub-direct: Meimei's view of Lakan's interaction with Meimei. Through this and the next scene, there is implied to be some feelings between her and Lakan, but only partway.
      - Also shares a cruel irony with the true story of [[Lakan's Mistake]], since Fengxian thought that she could get everything she wanted through her trick, but ended up in her current state ^d2102c
      - However, also partakes in the flipside of that irony; that Fengxian/Lakan ends up coming together, even if it was nearly 20 years later than desired
  - Meimei says that because she's getting older, she should take getting bought out more seriously
  - We see a flash of Meimei playing go with Lakan
    - It feels presented as if Meimei likes those times with Lakan, at least in part (like she was just saying)
  - But she's going to wait a little more
  - Maomao considers what might be going through Meimei's mind
    - She says if it's love (ÊÅã), then it's something she left behind before birth
  - The three goddesses join to scrub Maomao's back and dote on Maomao
- Back in the palace
  - Jinshi reflects
    - He wasn't expecting the place to offer brothel services #why
  - Jinshi brings Maomao the [[S01E16 - Lead#^64a592|drink vessel]] that Lakan left him
  - Suiren instructs Maomao that the dinner tonight will be vegetarian
  - Maomao continues to be distracted by issues with Lakan due to the vessel
    - She doesn't question the vegetarian meal because of this distraction
  - Suiren instructs Maomao to not stash herbs in the storehouse anymore but instead ask for a room
    - Maomao says that wouldn't be proper
    - Suiren reflects that Maomao knows her place
    - But also says that status is complex and does not fully define a person
    - And, finally, almost in a way that goes against her typical viewpoint, Suiren recommends that breaking the separation of status is needed in order to not miss opportunities ^7936b7
- Picking up medicine
  - Maomao goes to the outer court pharmacy to pick up medicine
    - What medicine?
  - It's very advanced compared to the rear palace's
  - While she's freaking out, [[Suirei]] appears behind her
    - [[Suirei]] asks what she is doing
  - A male doctor comes out, happy to see [[Suirei]]
    - [[Suirei]] says that she's there to resupply the medicines at the guardhouse
  - Maomao reflects on the "guardhouse" part
    - She ran into [[Suirei]] at the military wing near the mound
  - It seems that [[Suirei]] doesn't like Maomao
  - [[Suirei]] finishes up her business, leaving the doctor looking disappointed
    - He says "A court lady shouldn't be doing this..."
- Reflecting on Jinshi
  - Medicine tastes like potato flour
  - Jinshi is mysterious
    - Gets assigned peculiar work every few weeks
    - Takes long baths the day before
    - Burns incense before leaving
    - Eats vegetarian food
    - As if he's preparing for a purification ritual
    - There's a contradiction in the status of these practices and the status of a eunuch
- Jinshi asks about Luomen
  - Jinshi is signing documents
  - He raises the question of whether Luomen had been a doctor in the rear palace
- Picking up with Lakan
  - Jinshi accuses Lakan of playing dirty tricks to drive a wedge between Jinshi and Maomao
  - Lakan accuses Jinshi of stealing Maomao from him
  - Lakan had spent a decade convincing Granny to sell off Maomao to Lakan, only to have Jinshi beat him to the punch
  - He says he'll pay whatever Jinshi asks, since he does not want to repeat his past mistakes
    - This is a reference to what he said before about the bidding war on Fengxian, and in real life the fact that he could not afford her and that seeming to lead to the destruction of everything he valued
  - Jinshi asks what Lakan will do if Jinshi refuses
    - Lakan says he would not be able to do anything
    - And put a point on it by implying knowledge of Jinshi's true rank
  - Lakan confirms that Maomao is his daughter, completing his current conception of the truth of what happened
- Maomao does not want to meet with Lakan
  - Jinshi, feeling in a bind, finds Maomao returning from her duties
  - He says that an official wants to meet her, and then mentions Lakan by name
  - Maomao's emotionless mask slips for a moment, and Jinshi realizes that this is off limits for her and backpedals, saying that he'll find a way to turn Lakan down. This is interesting coming right after Lakan implied that Jinshi is one of the most powerful people in the country ^495aa4
  - Maomao returns to work
  - Jinshi reflects on the face Maomao made and that he never wants to see it again
  - Maomao fully realizes that he's found out about her relation to Lakan
- At the [[Garden Mound]]
  - She goes to the green mound at the entrance of the military wing
  - Smells that it's a herb garden, starts foraging
  - [[Suirei]] appears behind her again with a garden scythe
  - [[Suirei]] says that the mound is not off limits, but that other people use it too
  - Maomao asks if [[Suirei]] is responsible for it
    - [[Suirei]] neither confirms not denies, but says that she's allowed to plant whatever she wants there
  - [[Suirei]] pulls out weeds
  - Maomao asks [[Suirei]] what she is planting
    - [[Suirei]], surprisingly, says that she's making a medicine to resurrect someone
    - After Maomao gets excited, [[Suirei]] says that she was joking
  - She states that she's heard that Maomao is an apothecary and asks if she's good
    - This knowledge may be seen as the inciting event for [[Suirei]]'s change in demeanor towards Maomao due to [[The Shi Clan's Quest for Eternal Life]]
  - [[Suirei]] says that she will be planting [[Morning glory]] soon ^92c8df
