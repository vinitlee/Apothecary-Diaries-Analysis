- 5:20 - ~~I have no idea what is supposed to be happening in this scene. [[Maomao]] seems to clearly come from the large building at the north edge of the south entrance courtyard, but then she sees [[Jinshi]] going up the stairs right in front of her, where there should not be stairs.

The door he is in front of is plausibly the gate, bu~~ Okay, I think I figured it out. The cuts and eyelines are weird, but here's what happens. She comes out of the N building of the S entrance courtyard, looks around, and sees [[Jinshi]] going up the NE side stair. She goes in a U, not in a line. This suggests some things about the location of [[Jinshi]]'s office, though he may have been headed somewhere else on the E side of the [[Rear Palace]]
