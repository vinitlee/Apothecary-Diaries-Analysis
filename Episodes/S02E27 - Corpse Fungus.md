	- [[Concubine Jin]] has died
		- She had been bedridden for around a year
			- #maybe we might have some clue of what caused this from S01
		- The cause of death was reported as food poisoning

		- The hairpin was from an up-and-coming bureaucrat
		- Matron wanted her to stay
			- Who is the matron?
	- [[The Cat]] claws at [[Maomao]]'s skirt
	- No idea where [[Court Lady Tao]] went
	- However, this is not an uncommon occurrence
		- Many women of the rear palace have "interpersonal concerns"
	- [[Maomao]] reflects on the nature of the [[Rear Palace]]
		- "flower garden" with 2000 women
- Outdoor tea party
	- [[Maomao]] sees [[Gyokuyou]] having tea with [[Jinshi]] at an outdoor gazebo by a lake
	- She figures that if [[Gyokuyou]] stays inside too much, people will get suspicious that she is pregnant
	- [[Gyokuyou]] is being diligent in choosing the place and her attire, but [[Maomao]] thinks someone outside of the trusted group has likely already noticed
	- [[Gyokuyou]] calls [[Maomao]] over and says that [[Jinshi]] has need of her
	- [[Jinshi]] suggests that he and [[Maomao]] talk elsewhere
		- [[Gyokuyou]] says that she does not mind them talking there
		- But [[Jinshi]] politely opposes this ^5d58ea

				- [[Gyokuyou]] needs to take care of [[Lingli]]
- [[Jinshi]] talks to [[Maomao]] about literacy
	- [[Jinshi]] brings up the [[Novel]] that the [[Emperor]] gifted to the [[Concubine]]s
	- [[Maomao]] confirms
		- [[Emperor]] to [[Concubine]]
		- [[Concubine]] to [[Lady-in-waiting]]
		- [[Lady-in-waiting]] to other court ladies of the [[Rear Palace]]
		- People are making copies
		- Generating interest in learning to read and write
	- [[Jinshi]] shows plans to build a penmanship school
		- [[Get these girls to read]] up big
	- [[Maomao]] approves of the idea
		- Already those interested in learning to read and write
		- It will help them with work after their tenure
			- #hm it does seem that tenure and what happens after is coming up a lot in this season
	- [[Maomao]] criticizes the location
		- [[Southern Courtyard]]
		- It's near the main gate
		- It's easy to transport goods there
		- However, it's a common place for [[Concubine]]s to gather
			- They may not appreciate a school being there
		- She recommends renovating a building in the [[North ruins]]
	- [[Maomao]] makes a few more suggestions
		- Calling it "vocational training"
		- Give out occasional snacks
- Mushrooms
	- [[Jinshi]] mentions there's another thing
	- He asks if [[Maomao]] knows about [[Mushroom]]
	- [[Maomao]] says somewhat
		- Food
		- Medicine
	- [[Jinshi]] says that around this time of year, court ladies forage for mushrooms and get sick
	- [[Jinshi]] jabs at [[Maomao]] and brings up when she
		- Foraged for [[Matsutake]]
		- Took fruit from the orchard
			- #huh When was this?
	- [[Jinshi]] gives [[Maomao]] instructions
		- Find and dispose of any mushrooms in the area
		- Catalog poisonous varieties
		- Reduce [[Jade Pavilion]] roles other than food tasting
			- #why [[Maomao]] is confused by this, since he had [[S02E27 - Corpse Fungus#^5d58ea|just]] left a conversation with [[Gyokuyou]] and this seems like something that should be discussed with her present
			- She also notes that he's been giving her a weird look recently
- Starting looking for Mushrooms
	- [[Maomao]] considers places to start
		- Garden
		- Orchard
		- Pine trees
		- [[North forest]]
			- This is a good choice because the ladies are foraging in secret and there are too many people on the south side to be able to pull that off
- Looking for mushrooms in the [[North forest]]
	- Lots of mushrooms
	- [[Maomao]] smells something weird
	- She wonders if sewage is feeding the mushrooms
- Returning with mushrooms
	- [[Jade Pavilion]]
	- She's very dirty
	- Found a lot of mushrooms, some medicinal, dropped them off at the [[Rear Palace Medical Office]]
		- Told doctor that they were all poisonous
- [[Jade Pavilion]]
	- Timing is tight and [[Maomao]] is being rushed
	- [[Gyokuyou]] and [[Hongnian]] have black strings on the wrists
		- This means a noble person has died in the [[Rear Palace]]
	- [[Hongnian]] is going somewhere after dinner and wants [[Maomao]] to come with
- Going out with [[Hongnian]]
	- [[Hongnian]] explains that the person who died is [[Concubine Jin]], as mentioned in [[S02E26 - Caravan]] and the beginning of this episode
	- Reiteration of her description
		- Upper-mid-rank concubine
		- Daughter of high-ranking official
		- Bedridden for a year
		- Got food poisoning and never recovered
			- This may be more "foodborne illness" rather than "poisoned food," but it could swing either way
	- [[Hongnian]] says that she should have gone home, seeming to disapprove of [[Concubine Jin]]'s decisions.
		- [[Maomao]] notices a different tone than usual in [[Hongnian]]
	- [[Hongnian]] explains that [[Concubine Jin]] is not very nice
		- Jealous of other concubines and court ladies
		- Verbally and physically attacked others
		- Did not openly attack the [[High-ranking Concubine]]s
			- However, this coincided with the [[White Face Powder]] poisoning
			- [[Jinshi]] made an inquiry with her
			- She did not cooperate
		- There has been "turmoil recently"
			- Her ladies in waiting have been having a bad time
			- [[Hongnian]] is honestly relieved that she died
				- She is concerned that [[Concubine Jin]] may actually have had something to do with the [[White Face Powder]] poisoning
	- [[Maomao]] reflects on circumstances
		- [[Concubine Jin]] died of food poisoning
		- Ladies had gotten food poisoning from foraging for mushrooms
		- [[Jinshi]] very recently asked her to investigate poison mushrooms
		- [[Jinshi]] had asked her to do this in a manner that is hidden from [[Gyokuyou]]
	- She concludes
		- [[Jinshi]] may be suspicious of the people at the [[Jade Pavilion]]
		- [[Maomao]] rules out most of the people at the [[Jade Pavilion]], and realizes that she would be the prime suspect there
			- However, she does not actually rule out [[Hongnian]]
	- They are going to a funeral event for [[Concubine Jin]]
		- One of [[Concubine Jin]]'s ladies in waiting is handing out [[Lily]] flowers
			- She has a rash on the palm of her hand
		- There is an open casket with a cloth over the corpse and a place to put the lilies
		- [[Concubine Son]] rushes in, flips the table
			- She has rashes on her hand and arm as well
			- Missing hair
			- Bandages on her head
		- [[Concubine Son]] rips off the cloth covering the corpse and we see that there are rashes all over the face of the body, as well as missing hair
			- This seems similar to [[Concubine Son]]
		- [[Concubine Son]] laughs and says that [[Concubine Jin]] got what she deserved
	- [[Maomao]] realizes that there is a connection between
		- The inflammation on [[Concubine Jin]]/[[Concubine Son]]'s face
		- The poisonous mushrooms
		- [[Hongnian]] saying that [[Concubine Jin]]'s ladies in waiting had a rough time
- Looking for mushrooms again
	- [[North forest]]
	- [[Maomao]] is now wearing a face mask
	- [[Maomao]] reviews information
		- [[Concubine Son]] is a low-ranking concubine
		- From a wealthy merchant family
		- Good personality
		- Emperor visited her
		- Exactly two years ago
			- She fell ill, with rashes and hair loss
			- She lost all her status, life was ruined
			- Was permitted to stay in the rear palace out of grace of the [[Emperor]]
		- Why did she act like that at the funeral?
			- She thought that [[Concubine Jin]] was somehow responsible for the illness
	- [[Maomao]] finds a [[Fire coral mushroom]]
- Bringing the [[Fire coral mushroom]] back
	- [[Rear Palace Medical Office]]
	- [[Maomao]], [[Jinshi]], [[Gaoshun]]
	- [[Maomao]] is wearing a face mask and instructs the other two to do the same
		- Says the mushroom is extremely poisonous
	- Mushroom is in a wooden box
	- Explains
		- She found it in the [[North forest]]
		- Area was not maintained
		- Rare
		- Dangerous
			- Ingesting is lethal
			- Touching is harmful
		- [[Maomao]] has encountered this before and still has a scar
	- [[Maomao]] asks if [[Jinshi]] was looking for the source of this mushroom poison
		- [[Gaoshun]] confirms she's correct
	- [[Jinshi]] explains
		- [[Concubine Son]] contracted an illness two years ago and a mushroom was suspected as the cause
		- [[Concubine Jin]] was suspected as the culprit, but never proven
		- One year ago, [[Concubine Jin]] also contracted the same illness
			- She became depressed and could barely speak
			- She seemed like a different person
		- Her ladies in waiting attest that
			- She accidentally touched the poison when trying to use it on someone else
			- She took the poison to commit suicide
	- [[Maomao]] has a problem with that explanation
		- Eating the mushroom causes
			- Stomachaches
			- Vomiting
			- Paralysis
			- Inflammation inside the mouth
		- However, it would not spread to the rest of the face
		- The inflammation on [[Concubine Jin]]'s face seemed new, so it would not have been from the exposure a year ago
		- [[Maomao]] thinks [[Concubine Jin]]'s inflammation is indicative of someone rubbing the poison directly on her face
			- [[Concubine Jin]]'s hands were clean
			- But her lady in waiting had a rash on her hand
	- [[Jinshi]] sees that [[Maomao]] has figured something out and prompts her to tell him, but she's not sure yet
	- [[Maomao]] asks for
		- A few days
		- A few eunuchs who can keep a secret and do labor
- Looking for a body
	- [[Maomao]] brings [[Gaoshun]] and two eunuchs to the [[North forest]] to where the smell was
	- She sniffs around and find the source of the smell along with a bed of mushrooms
	- She has them dig at that spot
	- They find a wrapped corpse that has decomposed to the bones
	- It has jewelry on
		- Gold necklace with purple stone
		- Gold head thing
- Conclusions
	- The body was [[Concubine Jin]]
	- She died a year ago and her ladies in waiting covered it up
	- [[Court Lady Tao]] had taken her place
	- [[Maomao]]'s conjecture
		- [[Concubine Jin]] was jealous of [[Court Lady Tao]]
			- Because they looked similar, but [[Court Lady Tao]] had gotten a marriage proposal
		- There was a confrontation, [[Concubine Jin]] died
		- [[Concubine Jin]]'s court ladies covered it up
			- Partially self-preservation
			- Partially sympathy for [[Court Lady Tao]]
		- Her marriage talks became more serious an so playing the imposter became harder
		- The court ladies killed her to cover up what they had done
	- [[Jinshi]] asks [[Maomao]] how she knew where to look
		- Mushrooms growing there are the type that grow on corpses
		- [[Jinshi]] confiscates the mushrooms she has
	- [[Maomao]] ruminates on what a mushroom that grew on a corpse would do #huh 
# Inciting Events
