# Plot
- Gaoshun's brief
	- Jinshi has a medium ceremony today
		- More mysterious work
- Lihaku brings up the warehouse explosion
	- Lihaku says that it's recently been discovered that something had been stolen from another warehouse on the night of the explosion
		- We can assume that it was either the person who gave the pipe or someone connected to them
	- Multiple ceremonial tools were stolen
	- Management is currently poor
		- The old knowledgeable manager passed away a year ago and is Kounen from [[S01E09 - Suicide or Murder]]
		- The new manager is the bureaucrat victim in [[S01E15 - Raw Fish]] and is still in a coma.
	- The coincidences are stacking up
	- The pipe
		- Lihaku tried to return the pipe to the guard, but the guard didn't want it
		- A court lady (Suirei) had given him the pipe
			- She gave it to him after he walked her outside the castle
				- I'm a little confused by this, since we saw her give it to him outside of the warehouse, and the warehouses are in the military wing
			- She had been walking alone in the dark
			- Wearing a scarf to hide her face
			- Tall
			- Smelled like medicine
	- Maomao holds back from conjecture
		- But she suspects Suirei
- Briefing Jinshi
	- Maomao fills Jinshi in on the details, leaving out Suirei's name
	- Jinshi is concerned by the overlaps
	- Maomao comments on the fact that none of these seem like they were certain to work, so it's likely they were just the successful ones of many traps that were set.
	- Maomao does not seem excited, so Jinshi baits her by offering her an ox bezoar in exchange for her good work here
		- She gets excited
- At the archives
	- The bureaucrat that was poisoned was from the Board of Rites
	- The Board of Rites deals with ceremonies
	- Seems like they're targeting someone important
		- She remembers Jinshi's rituals
	- Librarian helps by showing her a scroll of plans for the Altar of the Sapphire Sky
		- West end of the outer court
		- Interesting design
		- Large pillar and banners hanging from the ceiling
	- Librarian used to work in the Board of Rites, but got demoted
		- He was concerned that the pillar would fall
		- When he voiced his concern, he was demoted and sent to the archives.
			- This feels suspicious
		- However, he now believes that it's strong enough
			- Why?
	- Maomao deduces that, if the pillar were to fall, the main person conducting the ceremony would be in danger
	- She also deduces that, if the tools were stolen, they would be remade and replaced
		- This bring the late metalworker and his sons to mind
	- Concerned, she asks when the next ritual is
		- It's right now
	- She runs out of the archive
- Running to the ritual
	- She suspects that lots of traps had been set, but these are lining up now
	- We see a Jinshi-like figure at the altar
	- At the steps of the Altar of the Sapphire Sky, she is stopped by a heavy guard who says that she does not have the right to interject
	- Maomao reflects on the fact that he's right; she does not have the right. Still, she is the only one that can stop something that might be putting lives at risk.
		- While also a major theme of the show, this is calling back when Suiren said [[S01E18 - Lakan#^7936b7|that sometimes you need to ignore status for the sake of not missing opportunities]].
	- The guard is sticking firm, even after Maomao has been clear about the issue
	- Maomao switches approaches and accuses the guard of being in league with the assassins
		- However, this does not end in the same way it typically does; Maomao is not in the rear palace anymore. The guard hits her extremely hard with an iron bat and she goes flying.
		- Still, she realizes this isn't enough and presses on as she's losing consciousness
	- Lakan appears from behind
	- Maomao stays staring forward, not turning around to see who she knows this voice belongs to
	- Lakan petitions for the guards to let her pass, letting slip for a moment that he's furious that she's hurt, similar to how she let her mask slip [[S01E18 - Lakan#^495aa4|last episode]].
	- She runs past, never looking back
	- She arrives in the altar room, where we see Jinshi in a ceremonial robe of the imperial family, flanked by the wire supports for the hanging beam
	- There are creaking noises, Maomao runs to push him out of the way
		- We see one of the large blocks of the design that has been teased through the entire second half of the season come apart. The bottom connection seems to turn to liquid.
	- The beam comes crashing down as Maomao pushes Jinshi out of the way
	- Maomao is reeling from everything, losing consciousness, grappling with seeing Jinshi here
		- She asks for the ox bezoar, mumbles about needing to stitch up her badly injured leg, wonders why Jinshi is here, and what the expression on his face is as she passes out
- Jinshi carries her through the palace
	- Jinshi carries her out from the altar room, down the steps on the opposite side to Lakan, who is in shock
	- Every official in the palace is bowing to Jinshi as he walks
	- Maomao leaves a trail of blood on the path from her injured leg
