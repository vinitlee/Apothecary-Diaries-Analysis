		- One of the servant girls is [[Shisui]]
		- The girls bow to him as he passes and then run off
		- [[Jinshi]] enters the [[Garnet Pavilion]] and we see that [[Loulan]] has many more ladies-in-waiting than before
			- We see 18 at the vestibule
				- 9 on each side
			- We see 3 on the stairs
			- The full number is obscured by a cut

- [[Jinshi]] and [[Maomao]], [[Maomao]] is distilling
	- [[Rear Palace Pharmacy]]
	- We come back to [[Maomao]] distilling
	- The [[Eunuch Doctor]] is helping by tending a fire for a second still (and seems overwhelmed)
	- The room is hot
	- [[Jinshi]] asks what she is doing 
		- [[Maomao]] explains that she found some stills and is making [[Scented oils]] from the roses they grew for the Garden Party in [[S01E22 - Blue Roses]]
			- This confirms that S02 is starting just days after the end of S01
	- [[Jinshi]] asks why she is not doing it at the [[Jade Pavilion]]
		- [[Maomao]] whispers to him that some [[Scented oils]] can cause miscarriages
			- The [[Eunuch Doctor]] is not to be trusted with information about [[Gyokuyou]]'s second pregnancy yet
		- However, she says that unless they're very concentrated, it shouldn't be a problem
		- [[Jinshi]] asks if perfumes will be an issue and it seems that they should be fine
	- [[Jinshi]] asks about the second still
		- [[Maomao]] is making high-proof alcohol
		- Not for drinking, but for disinfecting surfaces in the [[Jade Pavilion]]
	- [[Eunuch Doctor]] starts to bring in dessert and tea when
	- A delivery in a large purple package arrives
- The purple package
	- It's brought by 2 men
	- Wrapped in purple cloth
	- [[Maomao]] doesn't want [[Jinshi]] to know what's inside
		- Says that it's from her family
		- Says that it's undergarments
			- [[Gaoshun]] questions what undergarments would require two men to carry
	- [[Maomao]] explains that the issue is that the [[Rear Palace]] has a structural issue where the women brought in are expected to both be virgins and skilled at pleasing the emperor
		- So, [[Maomao]] wants to do sex education like in [[S01E14 - The New Pure Consort]]
			- But with more women
			- Using the books that are in the package
	- She is transporting the package out of the sight of [[Hongnian]] but now that effort has gone to waste
		- This introduces [[Hongnian]] as a slightly more named character in this season and more severe (though still kind) than we knew her from last season
	- She normally imports these from [[Verdigris House]] for the [[Emperor]], who likes the books, but multiplied the order this time
	- The books seem Kama Sutra-esque and contain both large pictures and words
		- [[Maomao]] says they're typical gifts for newlyweds
		- Easy to follow even if you cannot read
	- [[Gaoshun]] comments that the paper is of good quality
		- #why is the paper of good quality? Is the [[Eunuch Doctor]] helping source?
	- [[Maomao]] explains that the print is made with metal plates instead of the typical wood plates
		- This seems like a weirdly fancy book
	- [[Maomao]] reiterates the desire to share it with the ladies of the [[Rear Palace]]
		- [[Jinshi]] seems reluctant to concede the point, but keeps reading the book
	- [[Gaoshun]] makes the joke/suggestion that if [[Jinshi]] likes the book so much, maybe he can just keep a copy
	- [[Jinshi]] is embarrassed, but explains that he wants to know where they're printed so that he can learn more about their techniques
	- [[Gaoshun]] says that some of the more explicit parts of the books need to be censored and carries them off with [[Jinshi]]. [[Maomao]] says that the [[Emperor]] wanted more exciting ones, but [[Gaoshun]] isn't having any of it
- [[Maomao]] and [[Xiaolan]]
	- At the clothes washing area
	- [[Xiaolan]] is quoting something that sounds somewhat romantic
		- While eating a huge bao
		- "Oh, what is it that I seek beneath those beautiful flowers?"
			- "Manure?"
		- [[Maomao]] makes a joke and causes [[Xiaolan]] to choke on her bao
	- [[Xiaolan]] explains that the passage is from a popular novel
		- She cannot read
		- But one of the girls who can is reading it out loud
	- [[Maomao]] reflects that if even the illiterate girls know the story, it must be very popular
- [[Jade Pavilion]]
	- [[Yinghua]] and the other two ladies in waiting are gathered around a tan book, looking sheepish
# Lingering Questions
# Subplot and Themes
A teaser of [[Who is this new girl]] when [[Shisui]] is shown just before [[Jinshi]] goes into the [[Garnet Pavilion]]
[[The last Emperor's proclivities]] is in a way referenced by the way that the [[Emperor]]'s preferences and relative openness conflicts with how the [[Rear Palace]] has been set up, which can be seen in the problem that the books are trying to solve.
The sex books and the novel set up the challenge of [[Get these girls to read]]. [[Jinshi]]'s interest in finding the printer contributes.
[[The Cat]] gets in somehow, evoking [[How are things getting in and out]]
