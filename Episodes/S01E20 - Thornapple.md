# Plot
- Maomao wakes up with her injuries
	- She smells [[Sandalwood]] and is in Jinshi's bedroom
	- Suiren enters and explains that Jinshi had her brought to his room because it would be more comfortable than the infirmary
	- She needs to go debrief
- Debriefing
	- Basen is upset, unfairly lashing out at Maomao
	- Jinshi asks for an explanation of Maomao's investigations
	- Maomao says that there were many things that seemed like coincidences
		- Killing of [[Master Kounen]]
		- Fire in a warehouse and theft of ceremonial tools
		- Poisoning of [[Food-loving Bureaucrat]]
	- She goes on to say that the specifics of the ceremonial tools is important
		- They are responsible for holding the beam that fell
		- They are the piece that was stolen
		- They are the piece that failed
	- Basen says that they would just be replaced
		- Maomao knows this and thinks that they were replaced
		- However, they require high skill
		- So going to [[Metalworker Master]] for the replacements is natural
	- The metal part could have been made to melt when heated by a candle
		- Jinshi asks if the metalworker was a conspirator
		- Maomao does not suspect that, but rather he was just meeting a specification
		- Flashback shows [[Blue-eyed Man]] ordering the part
	- Maomao suspects that the metalworker was killed after he made the parts
		- The identity of the customer is concealed
		- The technique of low-melting-point metal is concealed, though this was recovered through his will
		- The metalworker may have been killed in a way that looked like an accident
	- The customer was in the know
		- Even though his sons did not know the low-melting-point metal technique, the customer had to have known in order to order it
	- Maomao shifts to considering why Jinshi was the one at the altar
		- [[Jinshi's True Identity|Who is this guy?]]
		- [[Suirei's Plot to Kill Jinshi|Why is he worth going through so much to kill?]]
		- She feels like going deeper into this will get her more trouble
- [[Lihaku]] gives an update
	- [[Suirei]] found to be involved with the [[Suirei's Plot to Kill Jinshi]]
	- Maomao had suspected it
	- She had been found dead
		- In her room having drunken poison
		- Doctors examined body and confirmed dead
		- Going to be cremated tomorrow
			- This seems like an odd choice? #why 
	- Lihaku says that she was solo and had no collaborators
		- We know this to be wrong, but this seems like a wild jump without the explanation as to why they think this
	- Maomao is surprised that Suirei would be able to pull off all the complicated plots alone
	- Maomao also questions whether Suirei is the type of person to have committed suicide
		- She acknowledges that Suirei was apathetic and emotionless
		- However, Suirei seemed to be testing her
	- Maomao remembers Suirei claiming that she's making [[Resurrection Medicine]]
		- And planting [[Morning glory]]
	- Maomao has a realization around [[Resurrection Medicine]]
- Confirming the conjecture
	- Maomao runs to Jinshi's office
	- Asks to talk to the doctor who examined the corpse
	- She wants to do it at the morgue
- Morgue
	- At the morgue where [[Suirei]] should be
	- [[Gaoshun]] disapproves of [[Jinshi]] joining
	- [[Flirty Doctor]] comes in as the doctor who examined the corpse
		- Maomao is expecting this and is suspicious
		- He was close to [[Suirei]], and now she's dead and accused of crimes
		- He was not an impartial party to do the examination
	- Maomao asks if the poison contained [[Thornapple]]
		- The doctor gives a "それは"
		- Maomao states that [[Suirei]] was growing [[Thornapple]] on the [[Garden Mound]]
		- Explains that it contains a strong poison that can be an anesthetic in the right amounts
		- She states that the pharmacy likely stocks [[Thornapple]]. Since [[Suirei]] had said that the doctors know about the [[Garden Mound]], they likely get it from there.
		- Finally, she ties it to what [[Suirei]] [[S01E18 - Lakan#^92c8df|had said]] about planting [[Morning glory]] in the [[Garden Mound]] since [[Thornapple]] looks like a white [[Morning glory]]
	- The doctor says he cannot be certain
	- Maomao uses a crowbar to pry up the lid of the casket
		- Suirei is not inside
	- The doctor says that he was sure it was Suirei, but that he did not perform an autopsy, and just felt for a heartbeat
	- Maomao states that his feelings for [[Suirei]] have been exploited since he did not take the appropriate measures due to his feelings
		- And that [[Suirei]] knew that this was going to happen
	- [[Maomao]] says that [[Suirei]] took a mixture, not just [[Thornapple]], and that the other components likely came from the [[Capitol Pharmacy]]. She blames the [[Flirty Doctor]] for not keeping track appropriately
	- [[Maomao]] explains that [[Suirei]] put a different corpse in a new casket to take her place so the weights would not be off for the cremation
	- Jinshi asks what happened with [[Suirei]]'s body
	- [[Maomao]] explains that [[Suirei]] was using [[Resurrection Medicine]] to make it seem like she had died in order to wake up later.
		- The medicine is somewhat mythical, but she knows some details
			- [[Thornapple]]
			- [[Fugu]]
	- [[Gaoshun]] find a coffin with marks where nails have been removed
	- [[Maomao]] speculates that collaborators smuggled [[Suirei]] out
		- They came in
		- The opened the casket
		- She woke up
		- They replaced the casket
		- They disguised her as a vendor
		- They left
	- The hypothetical flashback shows [[Suirei]] dressed in a way that she looks like the [[Blue-eyed Man]] along with four collaborators
	- [[Maomao]] says that [[Suirei]] won, but didn't get a complete victory
		- Also says that she would like to meet [[Suirei]] if she's still alive
		- [[Maomao]] has respect for [[Suirei]]
- Loulan
	- [[Garnet Pavilion]]
	- We see a green gaiwan on a flashy table
		- In fact, the whole room is flashy
	- A lady in waiting is pouring tea for [[Loulan]]
	- Another lady in waiting calls out to [[Loulan]], runs over, and whispers something in her ear.
	- We see a closeup of Loulan's right eye
		- It either narrows or casts down upon hearing the whisper
		- The timing of this suggests that it's either about [[Maomao]] figuring out the plot or about [[Suirei]] successfully escaping, though it's more likely it's about the escape from the next scene
- Jinshi reflects
	- Jinshi reflects on the events
	- Apparently, the events around [[Suirei]] have been kept a secret.
		- Which parts exactly? It seems like multiple people knew she was responsible, so did they just play it as if they had never learned about the resurrection?
	- [[Flirty Doctor]] says that his teacher had recommended [[Suirei]] for the role
		- The teacher had noted her talents a few years ago and brought her in as an adopted daughter
		- Her past before being adopted is not well known
	- [[Jinshi]] is worried about [[Maomao]]
		- Injuries
		- [[Lakan]]
	- [[Gaoshun]] enters the room with silver cups on a tray
		- He tests it first and confirms that it seems normal
		- Jinshi jokes that means it tastes terrible
			- We instantly assume that must mean it's medicine of some sort
			- Interesting that they are both taking it
		- Jinshi drinks it while holding his nose
			- Gaoshun says that he should not hold his nose because it makes him look young
	- Jinshi starts to talk about the character he is playing
		- Jinshi
		- 24 years old
		- Became a eunuch 5 years ago, when the [[Emperor]] took over
	- But he makes it clear that this is a mask and not the truth
	- The drink is to suppress his manhood
		- And it might make Jinshi impotent at some point
		- He can't keep playing this part
	- When [[Jinshi]] says that applies to [[Gaoshun]] too, we learn that [[Gaoshun]] has kids and even grandkids
		- Older son has a child
		- Younger son is [[Basen]]
	- [[Basen]] and [[Jinshi]] are in actuality both 19. [[Gaoshun]] says that [[Basen]] is at the right age to get married, so this would imply that he thinks that [[Jinshi]] is at the right age to get married
	- [[Jinshi]] notices this implication and asks if [[Gaoshun]] is asking him to finish this work
		- [[Gaoshun]] says that he'd like to have time with his grandchild, so yes
		- [[Jinshi]] says that he'll try to complete the work
		- This implies that there is some distinct goal of [[Jinshi]]'s work, it's not just undercover management or make-believe
- [[Loulan]], the shape-shifter
	- [[Garnet Pavilion]]
	- [[Jinshi]] visits [[Loulan]], who looks very different than she has in the past
		- She still has yellow eyes, but her hair, dress, and figure all look very different
		- Her style is much less flashy than it originally was
		- The room also looks redecorated
		- She sits down on her throne but does not lean on her hand, instead sitting up straight and keeping her hands in her lap
	- [[Jinshi]] narrates that [[Emperor]] visits [[Loulan]] often, but does not find her very appealing
		- She changes style and makeup often
		- She seems like a different person every time he visits her
		- But still visits her ever 1.5 weeks
	- [[Loulan's Father]] is a high-ranking official who was the [[Previous Empress Dowager]]'s favorite
		- The [[Emperor]] needs to be careful around [[Loulan's Father]]
	- [[Jinshi]] connects this to [[Lishu]], saying that she is unappealing as well since the [[Emperor]] does not share the [[Late Emperor]]'s taste for young girls
- Jinshi reflects on his birth
	- Retells that [[Ah-Duo]] and [[Empress Dowager]] gave birth at the same time, but only one baby (thought to be the [[Empress Dowager]]'s child) survived.
		- He says that [[Luomen]] had spent the whole time with the [[Empress Dowager]]'s delivery, which went successfully
		- [[Ah-Duo]] received no attention and lost her uterus
		- [[Ah-Duo]]'s child is said to have died shortly after
	- However, if [[Ah-Duo]]'s child had survived, they would not be so desperate for the [[Emperor]] to produce an son heir
- News at the [[Jade Pavilion]]
	- [[Gyokuyou]] seems worn out
- Reposting [[Maomao]]
	- [[Gyokuyou]] missed her period, might be pregnant
	- [[Maomao]] is to start working in the [[Rear Palace]] to help [[Gyokuyou]] during her pregnancy
# Lingering Questions
Why is Jinshi playing this role?
# Subplot and Themes
[[Thornapple]] is visually similar to [[Morning glory]]. However, one is poisonous and the other is medicinal. This is parallel to the double life of [[Suirei]].
[[Jinshi's True Identity]] deepened through the drink at the end of the episode
