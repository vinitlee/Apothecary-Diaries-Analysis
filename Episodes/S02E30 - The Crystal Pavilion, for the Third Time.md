	- They hear a cough

		- She says [[Shin]] is wearing perfume today

		- [[Maomao]] needles [[Shin]] and says that [[Shin]] does not value the life of a servant girl
		- [[Maomao]] brings up when she was treating [[Lihua]]
			- They had burned incense to cover up the smell of sick
		- [[Maomao]] thinks this time, it's inverted; the sick servant girl is in the shed to hide the contents of the shed

		- Platform shoes
		- Makeup

	- [[Lihua]], [[Shin]], [[Jinshi]], [[Gaoshun]], [[Maomao]]
	- [[Shin]] is standing opposite everyone else
	- [[Jinshi]] asks [[Shin]] for an explanation for the retained perfumes
		- They were being confiscated because they could make poisons
		- [[Shin]] remains silent, then turns to [[Lihua]]
	- [[Maomao]] voiceover explains
		- [[Shin]] and [[Lihua]] are cousins
		- [[Shin]] is beautiful in her own right, and could easily be a mid-rank concubine
			- But she's serving [[Lihua]]
	- [[Jinshi]] poses another question: "What were you trying to do with these banned goods?"
		- [[Shin]] claims ignorance
		- She ordered the sick servant to sleep in the shed
		- But she claims to not have known about the perfumes
		- [[Shin]] also goes on the offensive and claims that [[Maomao]] and [[Eunuch Doctor]] snooping around was the real wrongdoing here
		- She further diffuses the guilt by claiming that any number of people could have put these perfumes in the shed
	- [[Jinshi]] says that they can ask the sick servant girl
		- [[Shin]] challenges this by saying that she was barely conscious, feverish, and so her account cannot be trusted
			- [[Maomao]] jumps on this and highlights that this means that [[Shin]] knew the state of the sick servant
			- [[Maomao]] implies that [[Shin]] has been visiting the shed
			- She also notes that [[Shin]] now has perfume scent on her, even though she had not when [[Maomao]] visited the [[Crystal Pavilion]] sniffing around
	- [[Maomao]] pulls a bottle from the case

		- Approaches [[Shin]]
			- [[Shin]] lashes out and scratches [[Maomao]]'s face, drawing blood

		- Equivalent to attempted murder of [[Emperor]]'s child
		- [[Lihua]] asks if it changes anything if the target was [[Lihua]]
			- Revealing for the first time to others that she is [[Lihua Pregnancy 2|pregnant]]
	- [[Maomao]] notes the signs that [[Lihua]] had been pregnant
		- Same fit as [[Gyokuyou]]
	- [[Maomao]] notes aspects of [[Crystal Pavilion]]
		- The ladies in waiting are bad because of [[Shin]]'s designs
	- [[Lihua]] approaches [[Shin]]
		- Says [[Shin]] never saw [[Lihua]] as a concubine
		- That [[Shin]] did not see her as worthy
		- That they both did not know who would be in which position until the last moment
	- [[Shin]] freaks out, pushes [[Lihua]] away
		- Says [[Lihua]] is talking down to her
		- Says that's what she always hated about [[Lihua]]
		- [[Shin]] was always better at studies and manners, but was viewed as lesser
	- [[Maomao]] considers the two cousins
		- Muses that it might come down to cup size
		- [[Shin]] means apricot, while [[Lihua]] means pear (blossom)
		- Seems like they were made to go together by their family and have similar upbringings and aspirations
		- However, [[Shin]] is someone who will let emotions cause her to do terrible things
	- [[Shin]] continues throwing her fit
		- [[Lihua]] is the daughter of the head of the family
		- Claims she ([[Shin]]) was raised to be the empress since birth
		- [[Jinshi]] interjects, asking if that's a confession
		- [[Shin]] goes to the crate of perfumes and goes to throw it at [[Lihua]]
			- Curses her to rot childless in the [[Rear Palace]]
	- [[Gaoshun]] stops her short and the perfumes shatter on the ground
	- [[Shin]] continues having a breakdown
	- [[Maomao]] stoops to [[Shin]]
		- You must love the [[Emperor]]
		- Because it seems like you like the title of Empress more than you feel for [[Lihua]]
			- It's possible that this is an awkward translation
	- [[Lihua]] has been mostly watching, quiet and reserved
		- She walks over and slaps [[Shin]] (hard)
		- She announces to [[Jinshi]] that
			- Her head lady in waiting has verbally abused her
			- To the point that she raised her hand to her
			- And so she's firing her
		- This seems to be a form of grace; we can assume that by firing [[Shin]], [[Lihua]] is sparing her likely capital punishment
	- [[Maomao]] notes that [[Lihua]] has grown a lot from when she first met her
		- As understood above, the punishment is lenient and generous
- Outside the [[Crystal Pavilion]]
	- [[Jinshi]], [[Gaoshun]], [[Maomao]]
	- [[Jinshi]] pushes a white silk handkerchief to [[Maomao]] and urges her to wipe the blood from her face
	- She doesn't want to soil such a fancy thing
	- [[Jinshi]] asks her how she figured everything out
	- Explanation
		- Since the servant had not been seen, she was somewhere out of sight and far from bedrooms
		- Bush that was noticed before was white, but is typically red. Green and white is believed to bring good health in feng shui
		- Ironically, the white powder in the seeds of this plant can be used to make an abortive medicine
	- [[Jinshi]] reacts to this and says that there are poisons everywhere
		- [[Maomao]] reminds him that knowledge is needed to transform things into poisons
		- However, it's unlikely that [[Shin]] would have normally had this knowledge, so it's possible that the information came from a third party
		- Additionally, the events stack up a little too neatly
	- [[Jinshi]] asks if this means there's someone spreading this information in the [[Rear Palace]]
		- Not sure, but they will need to stay careful
	- The servant girl friend of the sick girl comes right after [[Jinshi]] leaves
		- Asks about the sick girl
			- Getting treatment outside of the [[Rear Palace]]
				- Lihua is paying for it
		- Has some of the white flowers
		- Is happy to hear
- [[Crystal Pavilion]]

		- [[Lihua]] asks if there is something wrong
		- He denies and drinks the glass
- #shot of the [[Shrine-like building]]
# Inciting Events
# Lingering Questions
What are the three times?
- Rehab of [[Lihua]]
- ?
	- Sniffing?
- This episode

It's wild that [[Shin]] was just not present when [[Maomao]] was taking care of [[Lihua]]. I strongly suspect this is an artifact of the book/manga adding [[Shin]] around this point, but the anime includes more characterization in [[S01E01 - Maomao]] though [[Shin]] discarding [[Maomao]]'s warning
