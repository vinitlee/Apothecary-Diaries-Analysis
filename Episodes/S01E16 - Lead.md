# Plot
- Setup
	- Palace metalworker passed away
	- He did not pass his secret technique to his sons
	- Shown: shot of the metalworker making the crucial piece which will fail in the assassination attempt
	- He has three sons who were also his apprentices
	- Jinshi wants her to figure out the secret technique
	- The metalworker will came with deliberate instructions
		- Eldest son got the workshop shack
		- Middle son got a piece of furniture (chest of drawers)
		- Youngest son got a fishbowl
		- "You should have a tea part together, like old times"
- Going to investigate
	- Going with Basen
- At the metalworker's house
	- Walking through the halls, Maomao notices a lead chunk on display
	- Clues
		- Shack is not used for work anymore
		- Chest is bolted in place
		- There's a western-style window in a weird location
		- There is a tree outside of that window
		- There is a pedestal in front of the window with a square mark on it
		- The fishbowl is made out of glass
		- The middle brother has a key
			- It should fit the middle keyhole but does not
			- The top drawers are locked with another missing key
		- The father was concerned about the sons until the end
		- When they sit down for tea, they sit in particular positions
		- There is no sun damage on the chest
		- If you break the lock, you break what is inside
		- The goldfish bowl used to have a goldfish in it on the pedestal
		- The father had symptoms of lead poisoning
- Interstitial shot
	- Three [[Japanese chestnut]] shells on the ground outside
	- We can assume that this is meant to relate to the sons in some way
- Solution
	- Put the bowl on the pedestal with water inside
	- It focuses light on the lock, heating it up and melting the low-melting-point lead inside
	- The provided key now fits and unlocks the middle lock
	- Inside the middle drawer is a mold for the lead to flow and make a key
	- The newly molded key can be used to unlock the top three drawers
- New Clues
	- The top three drawers are different sizes
	- Each contains a different material
		- Lead
		- Tin
		- A third metal
			- This is left unnamed, but may be [[Bismuth]], Indium, Silver, or Cadmium
				- Most likely is Bismuth, since Indium and Cadmium were not present during this era and silver would have been recognized
- New Solution
	- The metals should be mixed in ratios along with the size of their drawers
	- The metals are a metaphor for the brothers working together
	- The will was an attempt by the father to bring the brothers together again
- Wrapping up
	- The youngest brother petitions the other brothers for them to work together
		- He says that their father valued them for their own skills
		- And that they should work together
	- While leaving, Maomao plugs Luomen to the youngest brother, since he will be working with lead
- Lakan with Jinshi
	- Lakan thanks Jinshi for having Maomao look into it
	- Jinshi feels that Lakan already knew
	- Lakan says that the three brothers now work in different parts of the business
	- Lakan compliments the late master's work while making an implication
		- Says explicitly that if his metal parts were used on ritual utensils, they would look fabulous
		- Jinshi's disguise should have no association with ritual utensils, so this hints that Lakan is asserting that he knows the truth of [[Jinshi's True Identity]]
	- Lakan avoids answering questions, but adds another jab
		- "Elder or younger brother should not matter. Those with talent should receive attention."
	- Jinshi asks for the end of the story about the courtesan
		- Lakan does not answer, but instead pushes Jinshi to ask Maomao ^007674
	- Lakan gives Jinshi a drink vessel to pass on to Maomao ^64a592
	- Lakan leaves
	- Gaoshun starts to bring up an important matter
- Teaser scene
	- Jinshi asks Maomao to do his makeup
	- She is confused
