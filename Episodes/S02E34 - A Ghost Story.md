# Plot
- #shot of carriage at front (?) outer palace gate, heading out of the palace, with driver conversing with guard

	- [[Hongnian]] introduces them
		- [[Haku-u]]
		- [[Kaku-u]]
		- [[Seki-u]]
	- [[Yinghua]] explains that they are from the same hometown as the other ladies in waiting
		- [[Maomao]] is the odd one out
		- This is safer for [[Gyokuyou]]
	- [[Haku-u]] is the eldest and the same age as [[Gyokuyou]]
	- [[Maomao]] introduces herself
		- Messes up identifying [[Haku-u]]
		- The [[3 Sisters Ladies in Waiting]] will wear hair ribbons to match their names in future to help avoid confusion

	- [[Maomao]] wants SHED
		- She has it all set up and everything
	- [[3 Sisters Ladies in Waiting]] are watching the quarrel
	- [[Hongnian]] comes over and drags them away
- The Shed II
	- [[Gyokuyou]] gives [[Maomao]] permission to use the shed as she pleases, and so [[Hongnian]] asks [[Maomao]] to at least sleep in her proper room
- The increase in ladies
	- This is to accomplish a few things
		- More work because of [[Gyokuyou Pregnancy 2]]
		- Keep up with [[Loulan]], who has a large number of ladies-in-waiting
			- It would send the wrong message if the [[Emperor]]'s favorite had so many fewer
- The Shed III
	- [[Maomao]] heads to the shed after chores are done to make medicine

	- [[North ruins]]
	- [[Hongnian]] is aware of their excursion
	- [[Yinghua]] has [[Maomao]] put a white cloth on her head and does the same
	- [[Maomao]] wonders where they're going, since there should be only ruins and trees here
	- They make it to a small building in a forest
	- An [[Ghost lady|older lady]] greets them, has them extinguish their lantern and take a candle each
		- [[Maomao]] notes that she is pretty but old for a court lady
	- [[Ghost lady]] leads them down a hall
		- Explains that the building was used during the reign of the [[Late Emperor]]
