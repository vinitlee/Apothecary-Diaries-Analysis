	- The [[Emperor]] says that the roses are beautiful
	- [[Jinshi]] reflects on the attention his character gets
		- Some are lustful, and he finds that easy to exploit
		- Some are envious, and the finds that easy to manage
		- However, some are harder to read and those are a problem
			- [[Master Shishou]]

		- Reveals that she told the [[Emperor]] the trick first as a method of getting around any accusation of trickery
		- [[Emperor]] continues to be humanized by enjoying being let in on the secret
	- [[Jinshi]] asks if the rumor that there used to be blue roses is true
		- [[Maomao]] says that it could be if there was someone who kept feeding them blue dye
		- We get a flashback to [[Lakan]] doing it, so maybe that's what it was
	- [[Maomao]] says that she could have made better fingernail polish with [[Balsam]] and [[Woodsorrel]], since mixing them creates a vivid red

	- Didn't expect his provocation with the blue roses to fail
		- What was he trying to achieve?
		- Is he unhappy with this outcome or impressed?
- Go stones
	- Lead into next episode
	- Most people just look like go stones to him. Men black, women white.
	- People he can use look like chess/shogi/xiangqi pieces and change as they grow in real life rank
	- By having this very transactional view of humanity, he can be effective at his job
	- He seems bothered by the bright red manicures
		- He prefers and remembers fondly the pale red of [[Balsam]]
			- This is apparently written as 凤仙花 in Chinese and is read the same as [[Fengxian]]
	- He is stopped by the sight of [[Maomao]], [[Jinshi]], and [[Gaoshun]]
		- [[Jinshi]] is a 仕, which is a piece confined to the palace, a 3x3 position square in xiangqi where the general (king) starts. Its job is to protect the general.
		- [[Gaoshun]] is a 相, which is appropriate for a number of reasons, including that they are located next to the 仕.
		- [[Maomao]] is the only person here who has a human face in [[Lakan]]'s eyes
