# Plot
- [[Lihaku]] is out of it
	- He's worried about [[Pairin]] being bought out
- Back at the [[Rear Palace Medical Office]]
	- [[Maomao]] is bossing around the [[Eunuch Doctor]] and making him help clean up the [[Rear Palace Medical Office]]
	- They take a snack break and he serves sweets and tea
		- Sweet potato sweets
		- Served on paper
	- [[Maomao]] feels that he must be from a rich family because sweet potatoes are not in season and he's using good paper recklessly
	- His family is the paper purveyor for the palace
	- He talks about how well they used to do, but everything is in the past tense
	- The [[The Empress]] banned the cutting of trees
		- They started using alternative materials
		- His older sister came to work at the [[Rear Palace]]
		- His younger sister was going to also go to work at the [[Rear Palace]], but he opted to go in her stead and become a eunuch
			- Reading between the lines, we can guess that this was to protect her from the [[Late Emperor]], since she was younger
		- He never saw his older sister though
			- This is odd. This suggests that something bad may have happened.
	- [[Maomao]] reflects that the [[Eunuch Doctor]] has been through more than expected
- [[Lihaku]] is not having a easy time
	- He's stressing out about [[Pairin]] getting sold off
- Helping out the [[Eunuch Doctor]] with paper problems
	- [[Eunuch Doctor]] gets a letter from his younger sister saying that the family might lose palace purveyor status
	- This is because the paper quality has dropped
		- Everything is great, but the paper is weak
	- The only change is that they're using oxen now
	- Maomao deduces that the oxen's saliva is entering the stored water and dissolving the starch glue
		- The [[Eunuch Doctor]] wants to be tight-lipped about the glue formula
		- The [[Eunuch Doctor]] is kinda dumb
- Helping [[Lihaku]]
	- [[Maomao]] gets an urgent summons from [[Lihaku]]
		- She thinks it's about [[Suirei]], but he just wants to talk about buying out a courtesan
	- [[Maomao]] explains that there are two main clients of [[Pairin]]
		- Older man who visited the [[Verdigris House]] during the bad years
		- Younger man who is good but gets exhausted the next day
		- Neither seem ideal for [[Pairin]]
	- [[Pairin]] is very lustful, but also has a motherly side that few have seen
		- She lactates naturally
			- Nursed [[Maomao]] when she was a baby
		- Has a motherly side to her that [[Maomao]] feels has gone to waste
	- [[Maomao]] estimates the amount to be around 10,000 silver
		- [[Lihaku]] only makes 1000/year
	- He still wants to know the chances that [[Pairin]] will accept his offer if he finds the money
	- Funny scene of posing naked
- [[Jinshi]] shows up
	- He's distraught because he's misunderstanding the situation
	- Maomao reveals that she can read bodies to understand personalities
	- After some misunderstanding, it's clarified that [[Maomao]] was trying to assess [[Lihaku]]'s compatibility with [[Pairin]]
- [[Lihaku]] gets summoned by [[Jinshi]]
	- Jinshi says that he hears that [[Lihaku]] is romantically pursuing someone
	- Lihaku gets defensive, but decides that he will draw the line at Jinshi making fun of Pairin
	- [[Jinshi]] offers him 20,000 to help him buy out [[Pairin]]
	- Lihaku is floored by the offer, but questions if it's alright for [[Jinshi]] to offer it, since they barely know each other
	- Jinshi says that Maomao's approval is enough
		- Calls her his cat
		- When [[Lihaku]] repeats the cat line, Jinshi seems displeased
	- [[Jinshi]] gives [[Lihaku]]'s backstory
		- Comes from a good family
		- Still worked hard to become a military officer in the capital
		- Discovered by [[Lakan]], assigned to lead a squad
		- Officially, the prior squad leader retired and [[Lihaku]] took his place
			- But there's more to the story
			- Seems like [[Lakan]] prefers [[Lihaku]] and pushed out the previous squad leader
	- [[Jinshi]] is testing [[Lihaku]] to see if he would be susceptible to bribes
	- [[Lihaku]] passes the test
		- Gives a romantic speech about it
- We get a little montage of [[Lihaku]] romancing [[Pairin]] in the ways that he can
- [[Maomao]] gets a letter from [[Pairin]]
	- She's still in the game
	- Waiting for her prince charming
	- If she likes [[Lihaku]], [[Maomao]] thinks he won't need 10,000 silver
	- The rumor that kicked off the episode came from [[Lakan]] inquiring about buying people out
- Closing scene
	- An attendant finds [[Lakan]] sitting at a pavilion. He seems to be late for a meeting
