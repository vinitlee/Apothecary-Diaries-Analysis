	- [[Jinshi]] asks what she is doing 
		- [[Maomao]] explains that she found some stills and is making [[Scented oils]] from the roses they grew for the Garden Party in [[S01E22 - Blue Roses]]

- The purple package
	- It's brought by 2 men
	- Wrapped in purple cloth
	- [[Maomao]] doesn't want [[Jinshi]] to know what's inside
		- Says that it's from her family
		- Says that it's undergarments
			- [[Gaoshun]] questions what undergarments would require two men to carry
	- [[Maomao]] explains that the issue is that the [[Rear Palace]] has a structural issue where the women brought in are expected to both be virgins and skilled at pleasing the emperor
		- So, [[Maomao]] wants to do sex education like in [[S01E14 - The New Pure Consort]]
			- But with more women
			- Using the books that are in the package
	- She is transporting the package out of the sight of [[Hongnian]] but now that effort has gone to waste
		- This introduces [[Hongnian]] as a slightly more named character in this season and more severe (though still kind) than we knew her from last season
	- She normally imports these from [[Verdigris House]] for the [[Emperor]], who likes the books, but multiplied the order this time
	- The books seem Kama Sutra-esque and contain both large pictures and words
		- [[Maomao]] says they're typical gifts for newlyweds
		- Easy to follow even if you cannot read
	- [[Gaoshun]] comments that the paper is of good quality
		- #why is the paper of good quality? Is the [[Eunuch Doctor]] helping source?

		- [[Jinshi]] seems reluctant to concede the point, but keeps reading the book
	- [[Gaoshun]] makes the joke/suggestion that if [[Jinshi]] likes the book so much, maybe he can just keep a copy

	- At the clothes washing area, a few days later
	- [[Xiaolan]] is quoting something that sounds somewhat romantic
		- While eating a huge bao
		- "Oh, what is it that I seek beneath those beautiful flowers?"
			- "Manure?"
		- [[Maomao]] makes a joke and causes [[Xiaolan]] to choke on her bao
	- [[Xiaolan]] explains that the passage is from a popular novel
		- She cannot read
		- But one of the girls who can is reading it out loud
	- [[Maomao]] reflects that if even the illiterate girls know the story, it must be very popular
- [[Jade Pavilion]]
	- [[Yinghua]] and the other two ladies in waiting are gathered around a tan book, looking sheepish
	- The [[Emperor]] has distributed these books to the concubines and they're instructed to hand the book off to other ladies of the [[Rear Palace]] when they're done with them
	- The books have the stamp of the printer's that the books from [[Verdigris House]] had, the shop that [[Maomao]] had told [[Jinshi]] of the other day
		- It's clear that [[Jinshi]] had these made
	- Novels are viewed as low-class for the high class, but they are a fitting gift from the emperor due to the quality of the book
	- There are at least 100 copies
- [[Jade Pavilion]] Kitchen
	- [[Maomao]] is making something with [[Ginseng]] and (?) [[Mint]]
	- [[Yinghua]] complains that she finished the current volume of the novel but wants to read more
	- Apparently, the novel is split into volumes and they will be distributed over time. [[Gaoshun]] is already working on getting the next volume printed.
	- The three [[Jade Pavilion]] ladies in waiting say that it's a waste for these books to only benefit them, but that sharing them outside the [[Jade Pavilion]] would not be taking proper care of the gift
	- [[Maomao]] gets an idea from this
		- She recommends that they make copies of the novel instead and distribute the copies
		- She figures that this is in line with [[Jinshi]]'s plan with the books
		- [[Jinshi]] intends to
			- Distribute the books in the [[Rear Palace]]
			- Generate interest in the story
			- Generate interest in reading the story
			- Increase the literacy in the [[Rear Palace]]

	- However, [[Maomao]] is confused where [[The Cat]] could have come from
		- Not many pets in the [[Rear Palace]]

# Lingering Questions
Where did the cat come from?
# Subplot and Themes
A teaser of [[Who is this new girl]] when [[Shisui]] is shown just before [[Jinshi]] goes into the [[Garnet Pavilion]] and when she catches [[The Cat]]
[[The last Emperor's proclivities]] is in a way referenced by the way that the [[Emperor]]'s preferences and relative openness conflicts with how the [[Rear Palace]] has been set up, which can be seen in the problem that the books are trying to solve.
The sex books and the novel set up the challenge of [[Get these girls to read]]. [[Jinshi]]'s interest in finding the printer contributes.
[[The Cat]] gets in somehow, evoking [[How are things getting in and out]]
