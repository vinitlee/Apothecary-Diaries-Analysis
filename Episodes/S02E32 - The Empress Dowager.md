# Plot
- #shot of [[Empr Dow Anshi]] and a court lady standing in front of [[Late Emperor's Room]]
- [[Maomao]]'s new room
	- [[Hongnian]] and [[Yinghua]] bring [[Maomao]] to a storage shed
	- [[Hongnian]] tells [[Maomao]] that it will be her new room
		- This is supposed to be a punishment
		- This is because [[S02E30 - The Crystal Pavilion, for the Third Time#^bb935b|of when she caught a lizard tail]] in front of [[Yinghua]]
	- [[Hongnian]] tells [[Maomao]] to think about what she did
	- #flashback after [[Maomao]] caught the lizard tail
		-  [[Yinghua]] has fainted
		- She's disgusted by the lizard tail
		- Threatens that one of these times [[Hongnian]] will punish her by making her sleep in the storage shed
		- [[Maomao]] is excited by this instead of scared
			- Bigger
			- Could make noise
			- Proceeds to take the initiative to report herself to [[Hongnian]]
		- Back at her room with [[Hongnian]] and [[Yinghua]], we see all her illicit drug making
	- [[Hongnian]] thinks she's punishing [[Maomao]], but [[Maomao]] is thankful
		- Starts planning new workspace room
	- [[Hongnian]] is confused
- The other ladies in waiting
	- [[Jade Pavilion]] kitchen
	- [[Maomao]], [[Yinghua]], [[Ailan]], [[Guiyuan]]
	- [[Guiyuan]] is telling off [[Yinghua]] for reporting [[Maomao]]
	- [[Yinghua]] is defending herself by explaining that [[Maomao]] reported herself
	- [[Yinghua]] tells [[Maomao]] to stop collecting insects
		- But she's collecting [[Lizard]] tails, not insects
		- And she stopped after [[Yinghua]] asked her to
			- [[Yinghua]] is temporarily touched
	- [[Yinghua]] explains that there's a rumor about a court lady catching bugs while laughing to herself
		- Sounds like [[Shisui]]!
- Snacks with [[Xiaolan]]
	- [[Maomao]] has brought [[Xiaolan]] snacks to get information about [[Shisui]]
	- Apparently, [[Shisui]] is "a real phantom"
		- We can assume that [[Shisui]] comes and goes frequently without notice
	- [[Xiaolan]] runs over to ask the other girls if they know where [[Shisui]] is
	- The other girls don't want to give information out of caution because [[Maomao]] directly serves a [[High-ranking Concubine]]
		- I assume this means they're afraid of getting [[Shisui]] in trouble
		- [[Xiaolan]] is exceptional because she likes talking and also knew [[Maomao]] from before
	- [[Maomao]] bribes them with the [[S02E30 - The Crystal Pavilion, for the Third Time#^54ff55|handkerchief]] that [[Jinshi]] had given her
- Finding [[Shisui]]
	- [[North forest]]
	- The laundry girls said she's usually here
	- This is also where [[Maomao]] ran into her before and where we've seen [[Shisui]] a few times before
	- Depending on the location of the [[Jade Pavilion]], it may also be near where the cat was found
	- There are mosquitos
	- [[Maomao]] sees [[White Blossom]] flowers in both red and white
		- We saw these recently in [[S02E30 - The Crystal Pavilion, for the Third Time]]
		- They were called out to be able to be made into an abortive drug
		- She recalls that she used to collect the seeds of [[White Blossom]] with the courtesans
			- While they can be used for makeup, she made abortion drugs with the seeds
	- [[Maomao]] reflects on [[Shin]]
		- She was trying to take [[Lihua]]'s place
		- Not wearing perfumes at first to avoid miscarriages
			- Does this mean the [[Emperor]] was visiting her?
		- She risked wearing perfume in order to sabotage [[Lihua]]'s pregnancy
		- [[Lihua]] is likely pregnant as well
	- #shot of [[Maomao]] wiping a pink stain from the flower with a handkerchief
		- Is this an allusion to miscarriage blood or something?
	- [[Maomao]] realized something else from the [[S02E30 - The Crystal Pavilion, for the Third Time]] incident
		- Nearly all components of the abortion drug are available by foraging in the rear palace
			- [[White Blossom]]
			- [[Lantern Plant]]
			- [[Peony]]
			- [[Balsam]]
			- [[Mercury]]
		- Mercury is not
		- Even though that's the case, [[Shin]] got the drug components from the [[Caravan]]
			- This means that she did not have the knowledge
			- She was being fed instructions to make the poison
			- That person likely has some connection to the [[Caravan]]
			- And that person is still likely in the [[Rear Palace]]
	- With the last thought, we see [[Shisui]]
		- This sort of trailing off and switching focus has been used a lot to imply things about the one being switched to
- Catching crickets
	- [[Shisui]] jumps from a bush after a crickets
	- Captures it
	- A cricket lands on [[Maomao]]'s head
	- [[Shisui]] jumps to grab it and squishes it on [[Maomao]]'s head
- At a palace well
	- [[Maomao]] is washing bug guts out of her hair
	- [[Shisui]] apologizes
	- [[Maomao]] asks about the insects
	- [[Shisui]] pulls her over and sits her down on a crate and starts telling [[Maomao]] all about the insects
		- Native to this world's Japan
		- Make noise by rubbing their wings together
		- Probably part of trade goods and escaped and then multiplied
		- Similar looking to cockroaches, but they're different
	- She's very excitable
- [[Empr Dow Anshi]] walks through
	- They hear a wooden clacker
	- [[Maomao]] recognizes her
		- Last saw at garden party
		- She looks young
	- Procession of the [[Empr Dow Anshi]] heading to the [[Clinic]]
		- [[Empr Dow Anshi]]
		- 1 shade eunuch
		- 1 fan eunuch
		- 1 clacker lady
		- 1 young lady
		- 1 [[Older serving woman|older lady]]
	- [[Shisui]] explains that she's probably headed to the [[Clinic]]
		- [[Empr Dow Anshi]] set up the [[Clinic]]
		- However, this happened during the reign of [[The Empress]]
			- So, [[Empr Dow Anshi]] could not make the [[Clinic]] official
			- This is an interesting detail, suggesting that there was at least some opposition between the two women
	- [[Shisui]] says that the [[Empr Dow Anshi]] is very kind
		- How does she know?
	- [[Shisui]] explains that [[Empr Dow Anshi]] is behind the ban on slavery and castration
		- [[Maomao]] sees this as generally good
		- However, she is aware of the grey areas, specifically in courtesans
		- Officially, slavery is banned, but that just means that it exists under a different name now
	- [[Maomao]] wonders if the [[Empr Dow Anshi]] is going to the [[Clinic]] in response to the incident at the [[Crystal Pavilion]], presumably regarding the sick servant
		- That may lead to large medical reforms in the [[Rear Palace]]
	- She wants to follow, but needs to report for duties
- Cleaning up the [[Jade Pavilion]]
	- [[Maomao]], [[Ailan]], [[Yinghua]], [[Guiyuan]] are cleaning the surfaces in the [[Jade Pavilion]] as [[Hongnian]] directs
	- [[Hongnian]] is getting on everyone's cases and demanding that everything be spotless
	- [[Maomao]] wonders if there's a visitor
- [[Empr Dow Anshi]] comes to visit the [[Jade Pavilion]]
	- She still has the procession, but the [[Older serving woman]] is now missing from it
	- [[Gyokuyou]] and all ladies in waiting are bowing to her
	- [[Empr Dow Anshi]] knows that [[Gyokuyou]] is pregnant
	- [[Empr Dow Anshi]] and [[Gyokuyou]] sit down for tea and mooncake
		- [[Empr Dow Anshi]] is holding [[Lingli]]
		- [[Maomao]] thinks it seems more like friends chatting than wife and mother-in-law
	- [[Empr Dow Anshi]] calls out to [[Maomao]], she recognizes her
		- [[Suiren]] had told her that [[Maomao]] was worth training
		- [[Suiren]] used to be [[Empr Dow Anshi]]'s lady in waiting
			- Somehow, [[Maomao]] still isn't putting things together
	- [[Gyokuyou]] says that [[Lingli]] seems tired and she will put her to bed
		- This is a cover to allow [[Gyokuyou]] to give [[Empr Dow Anshi]] time alone with [[Maomao]]
- [[Empr Dow Anshi]]'s problem
	- The [[Older serving woman]] is back and is in the room
	- [[Empr Dow Anshi]] says she has heard that [[Maomao]] solves problems
		- [[Maomao]] explains that she just speaks from her knowledge when the facts seem appropriate
			- She is trying to be humble/honest
			- Aware of her shortcomings compared to [[Luomen]]
			- But may have come across too negative
	- [[Older serving woman]] seems displeased with [[Maomao]]'s response
	- [[Empr Dow Anshi]] says that's fine
	- She wants to know if she put a curse on the [[Late Emperor]]
- [[Maomao]]'s shed
	- [[Maomao]] is rearranging the shed
	- She's considering the request
		- Only ever heard negative things about the [[Late Emperor]]
			- Foolish emperor
			- Idiot ruler
			- Puppet of [[The Empress]]
			- Pedophile
		- [[Late Emperor]] deliberately chose the youngest girls available despite access to more age-appropriate women
		- As a sign of this, [[Empr Dow Anshi]] has a scar from a Cesarian that was performed when she gave birth to [[Emperor]] since she was very young
			- [[Luomen]] became a eunuch in order to help with that surgery
			- That said, [[Emperor]] is healthy and she had another child later
				- [[Jinshi]] is one year older than [[Maomao]]
				- [[Empr Dow Anshi]] would have been nearly 30 then
					- She was not young anymore
					- [[Maomao]] questions the true parentage of the imperial brother
- All four [[High-ranking Concubine]]s with [[Empr Dow Anshi]]
	- [[Empr Dow Anshi]] invited the four [[High-ranking Concubine]]s to a tea party
	- In the #shot of [[Loulan]]'s entourage, it may by worth noting that [[Loulan]]'s eyes are darker than normal
	- [[Gyokuyou]] is getting sleepy during the day due to the pregnancy
	- The tea party is in [[The Outer Court]]
		- [[Yinghua]] finds this weird and scary because they never go there
		- But it is where the [[Emperor]] lives
		- [[Yinghua]] also feels that it is not being considerate of [[Gyokuyou]]
		- The ladies feel that [[Empr Dow Anshi]] is to be trusted with things like this
	- They are still concerned about other [[High-ranking Concubine]]s probing [[Gyokuyou]]
		- [[Lihua]] is likely also pregnant, so will likely not probe since questions could backfire
			- Also a proud woman who wouldn't stoop that low
		- [[Lishu]] is probably also safe
			- Her ladies in waiting might pressure her to ask
			- But her head lady in waiting probably won't support that sort of behavior
		- [[Loulan]] is the real wildcard
- [[Hongnian]] calls [[Maomao]] aside
	- [[Hongnian]] will be the taster at the party in order for there to not be a separate taster
		- This shows trust in [[Empr Dow Anshi]]
	- Also, [[Empr Dow Anshi]] wants [[Maomao]] to help with her problem today
	- [[Hongnian]] kabedons [[Maomao]] to make sure she stays faithful to [[Gyokuyou]]
- Starting the [[Empr Dow Anshi]]'s request
	- [[Maomao]] runs to meet the older serving woman that we've seen with [[Empr Dow Anshi]]
	- That servant tells [[Maomao]] that the area they are in used to serve the same purpose as the [[Rear Palace]] before the establishment of the [[Rear Palace]]
		- It is still immaculate even when unused
	- She leads [[Maomao]] to a set of doors leading to a room
		- Says that it's here, but they cannot go farther
		- In fact, no one can
		- But they can look inside
- [[The Late Emperor's Room]]
	- Dirty
		- Paint stains all over the floor
		- Distinctive smell
		- Brush and pigments on floor
	- This was originally the room of [[The Empress]] when she first became a concubine
	- During [[-2 Emperor]]
		- [[The Empress]] was a first court lady
		- Then became a low-ranking concubine
	- This was her room and the room where [[Late Emperor]] was raised
	- It is also the room where [[Late Emperor]] died
	- The [[Older serving woman]] seems disturbed and suggests they go somewhere else
- Continuing
	- During his final years, [[Late Emperor]] and [[The Empress]] both spent a lot of time in [[Late Emperor's Room]]
	- It seemed as if they were clinging to memories
	- [[Late Emperor]] died shortly after [[The Empress]]
		- [[Maomao]] confirms that [[Late Emperor]] was not young when he died
		- [[Older serving woman]] says that he was old enough for it to be labeled a natural death
			- I'm going to guess around 60. Not young but certainly not old
		- [[Maomao]] asks why, then, does the [[Empr Dow Anshi]] think she cursed him
	- [[Empr Dow Anshi]] feels certain that she cursed him since she wished for so long for him to go away, almost every night
		- We get out first strong representation of how she felt about the [[Late Emperor]] aside from [[Jinshi]]'s dream
	- [[Maomao]] asks if there is anything else that speaks to there being a curse
		- [[Late Emperor]]'s body was placed in a mausoleum
		- One year later before burying, [[Empr Dow Anshi]] and [[Emperor]] took a look at the body
			- And it had been well preserved, no decay
				- Given the environment, this should not happen
	- [[The Late Emperor's Room]] will be torn down soon, and [[Maomao]] is to finish the job before then
	- [[Maomao]] agrees, but has a request
		- It's a cliffhanger
