	- Maomao fumbles getting out of the situation
		- Asks if they're jealous of her
			- Gets slapped
		- Asks if they think she's getting special treatment
			- Says that Jinshi would not fall for her since she's not womanly, while they are
			- Does imply that if Jinshi were to go for her over them, he would be a deviant
				- It's possible that this is a reference to pedophilia
	- Suirei asks a question
		- "Why did he hire you, then?"
		- Maomao shows her test arm
			- The four are grossed out
