# Plot
- Rumors
	- [[Maomao]] reflects that the more that rumors spread, the farther they morph from the truth
		- This applies to the [[Moon fairy legend]]
		- But also to other myths and legends
- [[Maomao]] heads off
	- Goes to the [[Ruined Orchard]]
	- Sees the parts the [[Yarite Baba]] had described
		- Ceremonial platform
		- [[Ruined Orchard]]
		- Pond
		- [[Shrine of Choosing]]
	- This area used to be home to a different ethnicity, people of the [[Ancient Civilization]]
		- [[Empire of Li]] is using parts left over
			- Buildings
			- Walls
			- Underground waterway
				- #huh this seems to directly contradict ![[S02E26 - Caravan#^0e6623]]
- [[Shisui]] shows up
	- [[Shisui]] comes from behind and says guess who
		- [[Maomao]] guesses who
	- [[Shisui]] is holding leaves in her hand
		- There is a caterpillar inside
		- [[Maomao]] is not amused
		- [[Shisui]] thinks it's cute
	- [[Shisui]] has read books about insects
		- While this may seem mundane to the viewer, books have been fairly rare so far
		- This also suggests that she is literate
	- [[Shisui]] says the first time she's seen these particular insects is in the [[North forest]]
	- [[Maomao]] reflects
		- The city of the capital has been a trading hub for a long time
		- Insects from many regions may have migrated here on luggage
	- Nocturnal moths
		- The caterpillars become moths
		- They are nocturnal
		- [[Shisui]] has seen them and thinks they're pretty
		- [[Maomao]] wonders if these were around during [[Yarite Baba]]'s dance
		- The moths' effect
			- Sparkle in the moonlight
			- Make the area feel ethereal
		- [[Maomao]] realizes that this is similar to the description of [[Yarite Baba]]'s dance
		- Moth mating
			- Matured moths cannot eat
			- They die shortly after maturing
			- They mate right after maturing
			- [[Shisui]] can tell male from female
		- [[Maomao]] has an idea
- Montage

- Event starting
	- Full moon
	- Taking place in [[North ruins]], aka "Northern Garden"
	- Exception made to allow men to attend the event, even though it was in the [[Rear Palace]]
	- We see a line of rickshaw/palanquin/carriages. From stage right to stage left:
		- [[Lihua]]
			- [[Shin]]
		- Guard
		- [[Loulan]]
			- Lady in waiting
		- [[Cousin Special Envoys]]
			- [[Ayla]]
				- Fez guard
			- [[Aylin]]
				- Fez guard
		- [[Emperor]]
			- Guard
				- Eunuch
				- Guard
			- Guard
				- Eunuch
				- Guard
		- [[Gyokuyou]]
			- [[Hongnian]]
		- [[Lishu]]
			- [[Lishu's taster]]
	- [[Cousin Special Envoys]]' carriage and [[Emperor]]'s carriage are more forward than the rest and centered.
	- [[Cousin Special Envoys]] do not have the shade down, but the rest do.
	- [[Maomao]] is watching from the bushes
	- She is seeing the [[Cousin Special Envoys]] for the first time
		- She notes that they look striking and beautiful
			- Blonde hair
			- Blue eyes
		- Views this as an explanation why other beautiful performers didn't have an effect
	- [[Maomao]] notes that they have the blinds up
		- This is taken as confidently showing their faces to the [[Emperor]]
			- Is this meant sexually?
		- [[Maomao]] notes that [[Aylin]] seems more quiet, while [[Ayla]] seems more confident
		- They are both on-par with the [[High-ranking Concubine]]s in terms of beauty
- Event starts
	- Gong!
	- The event has been made to be more flashy, but the [[Cousin Special Envoys]] seem bored
	- [[Maomao]] notes
		- The envoys are cousins with a shared grandfather
		- But they appear like twins
		- They would be able to pull off the mirror trick from [[S02E28 - Mirror]]
	- [[Ayla]] leaves her carriage, strides up to the [[Emperor]]
		- She says she wants to sit with him
		- She says that she hears that his brother is not attending, but would have loved to meet him
	- [[Maomao]] realizes one of the [[Cousin Special Envoys]]' goals is to seduce and marry both the [[Emperor]] and his brother
	- Everyone else there either looks super awkward or quietly angry
	- [[Aylin]] interrupts [[Ayla]] and says that she should stop
		- Calls her Ayla
	- [[Maomao]] wonders if the envoys think that there is no one more beautiful than them
		- Perhaps the mirrors were a jab at the [[High-ranking Concubine]]s' beauty
- Fetching [[Jinshi]]
	- [[Maomao]] goes to a small building off to the side
	- [[Gaoshun]] and [[Jinshi]] are inside
	- [[Gaoshun]] says that he did everything he could
- Main event over
	- Gong
	- [[Emperor]] is first to leave
	- Other carriages have drivers in the seats, ready to leave
	- [[Ayla]] speaks to [[Aylin]]
		- The music was more colorful to match them
		- But the dancing was just average
		- [[High-ranking Concubine]]s were behind blinds
		- [[Moon fairy legend]] probably wasn't actually impressive
	- [[Aylin]] tells her off
		- Should not be discussing it there
		- Can talk in their room
	- [[Ayla]] responds by speculating of the [[Emperor]] lusting after them right away
- [[Jinshi]], the moon fairy
	- [[Maomao]] is standing in the brush on the W side of the S running road, between the road and the lake
	- She lifts a dark veil off of [[Jinshi]], who is dressed like the Moon Fairy
	- [[Ayla]] and [[Aylin]] are both shocked
	- [[Maomao]] lets go of his hand but he grabs hers
		- #why 
	- He does a dance with mote lights around him (the moths)
	- The envoys are eating this up like preteens at a Bieber concert
	- He disappear!
	- [[Ayla]] runs over and shakes [[Maomao]] by the shoulders
		- Speaks in a foreign language
			- Asks where she went and who she was
		- [[Maomao]] points to the moon and says
			- Diana
				- Moon goddess in [[The West]]'s tradition
				- This is very likely a reference to the Roman goddess Diana
					- Of the hunt, moon, and wilderness
- After the stunt
	- [[Maomao]] is entering a building where [[Gaoshun]] is waiting
	- They agree that it seemed to have worked
	- [[Maomao]] runs through the trick
		- Dark cloth to make it seem like [[Jinshi]] appeared
		- Moths
			- Captured moths
			- Rubbed female moth carcasses on the dress to attract male moths
		- Careful timing and support to make sure that only the envoys saw [[Jinshi]]
		- Jinshi jumped in the water
- [[Ayla]]
	- [[Three-storied building]], side building. [[Ayla]] is sitting facing W in the dark
		- It is likely right after the party, since moonlight is streaming in through the E facing window
	- She seems upset
	- She says "fine then" and looks at a wooden shape in the dark room ![[Pasted image 20250622163548.png]]
		- It is unclear what this is, but we may find out soon
- [[Rear palace laundry area]]
	- [[Maomao]] enters from N entrance
	- [[Xiaolan]] tells [[Maomao]] that she's headed to school
		- She's part of the first generation of students
	- She leaves by the S exit, weirdly enough
		- #huh I'm starting to suspect that the sunset scene might have been messed up
	- [[Maomao]] sits down to the side of the [[Rear palace laundry area]]
	- She's bored
		- Not much work to do at the [[Jade Pavilion]]
		- The [[Eunuch Doctor]] is busy managing the [[Scented oils]] issue
			- It's not completely resolved
- Scented oils
	- Flashback
	- [[Maomao]] is still suspicious that they were brought in through a conspiracy
	- [[Jinshi]] has been looking into it
		- However, they were popular across the [[Rear Palace]]
			- Not one specific person or group bringing them in
	- He wonders if the [[Cousin Special Envoys]] may be responsible
		- [[Maomao]] is not sure
		- She thinks that one of their [[The Envoys' Goals|goals]] is to become concubines
		- However, she thinks that the Moon Fairy performance was effective in disrupting their pride
- Back in the [[Rear palace laundry area]], [[Maomao]] is considering the situation
	- Four high ranking concubines in the rear palace
		- She draws pictures to represent them
			- Flower
				- [[Loulan]]
					- Father is [[Master Shishou]]
						- Very influential
						- "Favorite retainer"
						- Had his high rank since the [[Late Emperor]]
					- She should be the most important
						- However, the [[Emperor]] is not passionate about her
			- Pear (Asian pear)
				- [[Lihua]]
					- Ranks second in terms of family power
					- Maternally related to the [[Emperor]]
						- Means less hungry for power
						- #hm I wonder what this connection actually is. Does this mean the [[Empress Dowager]] is her aunt or something?
					- Fell ill after [[Lihua Pregnancy 1]] died
						- But got better and now the [[Emperor]] visits her frequently and likes her
							- We also know that she's pregnant now [[Lihua Pregnancy 2]]
			- Tree
				- [[Lishu]]
					- Family is up-and-coming and ambitious
					- Sent to [[Late Emperor]] as a child due to family ambition
					- Unfortunately for her family, she became a concubine only shortly before the death of the [[Late Emperor]], and the [[Emperor]] does not like kids (and specifically likes curvy women)
					- [[Emperor]] does not visit her at all
			- Leaf
				- [[Gyokuyou]] receives the most love of all the [[High-ranking Concubine]]s
				- Has [[Lingli]] and the current [[Gyokuyou Pregnancy 2]]
				- Comes from a neighboring nation to [[The West]]
					- This nation is booming from trade
					- However, the land is infertile
						- They say that they're not rich due to this fact
						- So they rely solely on trade
				- Has had two attempts on her life from poison
					- [[Fengming]] poisoning the soup, but it was intended for [[Lishu]]
						- And it was motivated by a private personal interest, not political ambition
					- [[White Face Powder]]
						- Not clear if this was a conspiracy
						- If it was, also unclear who did it
						- [[Hongnian]] thinks that it was [[Concubine Jin]]
							- #huh [[Maomao]] incorrectly describes her as the medium-ranking concubine who died the other day; she died a year ago
							- If it was her, then how did she learn about [[White Face Powder]] and [[Fire coral mushroom]] poison?
	- [[Suirei]]
		- She knew about poisons, but in a way where it felt like it was her specialty rather than bits of knowledge
		- No information on what happened to her
		- #why did she carry out [[Suirei's Plot to Kill Jinshi]]?
			- Why did she do any of the things she did?
			- For what cause?
			- Why [[Jinshi]]?
	- [[Maomao]] has drawn a spiral while thinking about [[Suirei]]
	- She puts off thinking more about these issues
- Encountering [[Shin]]
	- #shot of warehouses and orchards
	- [[Maomao]] muses that cherry season is almost over
		- So it's late spring
	- She sees 3 ladies in waiting for the [[Crystal Pavilion]] and [[Shin]] approaching from the other direction
	- The three ladies in waiting seem scared of [[Maomao]], but [[Shin]] seems unaffected
		- This is somewhat reminiscent of the first interaction with [[Suirei]]
		- The three rush past her
		- [[Shin]] stays looking at [[Maomao]] for a moment, and then continues
		- [[Maomao]] notes that [[Shin]] was the only one not wearing [[Scented oils]] at the [[Crystal Pavilion]] when she visited that time
			- That's weird since the [[Crystal Pavilion]] tends to be caught by trends
			- However, [[Maomao]] brushes it off
- [[Jade Pavilion]]
	- [[Ailan]] is feeling sick
	- [[Yinghua]] asks that [[Maomao]] bring [[Ailan]] to the [[Clinic]]
		- [[Maomao]] has not heard of the [[Clinic]]
		- [[Yinghua]] clarifies that she does not mean the [[Rear Palace Medical Office]]
	- [[Ailan]] knows where to go
- [[Clinic]]
	- [[Maomao]] did not know that the [[Clinic]] existed
		- It's on the N side of the palace
		- Close to the [[Rear palace laundry area]]
			- Good since it makes sanitization easier
	- [[Shenlu]] comes over to look at [[Ailan]]
		- [[Maomao]] is surprised to see a middle-aged court lady in the [[Rear Palace]]
	- [[Shenlu]] checks [[Ailan]]'s fever and tongue
		- She says that as long as [[Ailan]] takes it easy for a couple days, it should pass
		- But then asks [[Ailan]] what she wants to do
		- [[Ailan]] says she doesn't want to spread the illness
			- Asks to stay overnight
	- [[Shenlu]] seems professional and knowledgeable, better than [[Eunuch Doctor]]
- Walking through the [[Clinic]]
	- [[Ailan]] smells [[Alcohol]] and says that she hates the smell
		- This connects with [[S02E25 - Maomao and Maomao#^6a56e8|when Maomao was explaining using alcohol for disinfecting in E25]]
	- The [[Clinic]] has a few elements that keep it clean
		- Disinfecting surfaces with [[Alcohol]]
		- Good ventilation
		- Simple, so easy to clean
	- [[Ailan]] gets a room to quarantine in
	- [[Maomao]] looks inside the room, but [[Shenlu]] scolds her and tells her to get back to work
		- Threatens her with folding the [[Clinic]] laundry
- Just outside the [[Clinic]]
	- There are many older women dressed like [[Shenlu]] who work at the [[Clinic]]
	- It's weird that there are so many older women, since there is a soft age cap in the [[Rear Palace]]
		- [[Maomao]] assumes that this is because [[Clinic]] workers need to have experience and knowledge and so stay longer
	- She runs into [[Jinshi]], who scolds her for walking while talking to herself
	- He doesn't seem to have anything in particular to talk about
		- But [[Gaoshun]] motions for [[Maomao]] to hold a conversation
	- [[Maomao]] explains that she's been at the [[Clinic]]
		- Didn't know it existed
		- [[Jinshi]] says that she should have been shown during orientation, but [[Maomao]] was not paying attention
			- I believe this is a 3.5th wall sort of way of saying that we're about to see a bunch of locations in the [[Rear Palace]] that we didn't previously know existed
	- [[Maomao]] compliments the [[Clinic]] and says that it should replace the [[Rear Palace Medical Office]]
		- [[Jinshi]] and [[Gaoshun]] explain that would be great, but impossible
			- Women not allowed to be doctors
			- Women not allowed to make medicine
				- They're looking the other way for [[Maomao]]
				- #hm [[Maomao]] suspects there's a convoluted backstory to these rules and this situation
	- [[Jinshi]] explains that they need to consider ways of getting non-eunuch doctors
		- Apparently, the [[Emperor]] banned the castration surgery that creates eunuchs five years ago
		- However, non-contrasted men are still not allowed in the [[Rear Palace]]
		- #huh this seems wildly impractical
		- The [[Rear Palace]] cannot replenish staff so faces an impending crisis
		- [[Maomao]] surmises that it would only make sense if [[Jinshi]] had been castrated right before the ban
			- We know this to not be true, but it should match [[Jinshi]]'s cover story
	- [[Jinshi]] and [[Gaoshun]] head off
	- Before leaving, [[Jinshi]] warns [[Maomao]] to make sure no one finds out that she makes medicine
	- [[Maomao]] muses on making a drug to grow back [[Jinshi]]'s family jewels
- [[Clinic]]
	- [[Ailan]]'s room
	- [[Ailan]] has powdered medicine in a paper and takes it orally
	- [[Shenlu]] sees her and questions her
		- She identifies that it is medicine
		- And that [[Maomao]] secretly made it
			- [[Maomao]] smelled like medicine
		- This is exactly what [[Jinshi]] just warned [[Maomao]] about!
