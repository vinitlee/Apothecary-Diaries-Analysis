	- She isn't playing well and loses two matches
		- He's a pro
	- He decides to forfeit the third match
		- Asks if he would taste the poison if he drank a cup with the poison
		- Maomao says it would taste bad
		- He picks a cup and drinks it
		- Says it tastes bad
		- Jinshi panics because he thinks it means that Lakan basically won
	- Lakan passes out
		- Drunk
- Lakan's story
	- Faceblind
	- His father ran off with another woman because of him
	- But he had time to study Go and Xiangqi
	- His uncle ([[Luomen]]) was the only person who understood and taught him to recognize people based on other things and to think of people as game pieces
	- He got very good at both board games as well as human chess
	- Went to [[Verdigris House]] to challenge a famous courtesan
		- Surprisingly, he lost
	- This was [[Fengxian]], the first person whose face he could fully see
	- [[Fengxian]] is likened to balsam in two ways
		- First, the color of her nails as she moved the Go pieces
		- Second, her defiant eyes, which he says were like a balsam flower that would burst if touched
	- They met for several years after that to play Go and Xiangqi and grew closer
		- She was born in the pleasure district, very similar to Maomao
	- Her popularity and price rose, and Lakan came to only be able to see her every three months
	- The last time they met
		- She was applying her nail polish when he came in
			- Balsam (fengxian)
			- Woodsorrel (cat's paw, liked to Maomao)
			- Both burst when you touch the ripe fruit
		- She asks him when next he can come
			- Three months
		- She tells him she's being bought out and that it's well above what he could pay
		- She offers a bet: if he beats her at a game, she will give him anything that he wants, and if she wins she will take anything that she wants.
			- She offers him the choice between Go and xiangqi.
				- She always wins Go, and he always wins xiangqi
			- He chooses Go
		- [[Meimei]] is her young maid
		- They don't finish the game and instead sleep together
			- It's her first time
			- Probably his as well
		- In bed, she says that she wants to play go and he thinks that he wants to play chess
			- This is both of them admitting that they want to be selfish and have what they want (each other) rather than what life is dictating for them
		- When drifting to sleep, [[Fengxian]] sings [[Fengxian's Song]] in its entirety
	- Three months later, [[Luomen]] is ousted from the [[Rear Palace]]
	- [[Lakan]] is forced by his father to go with [[Luomen]] to study abroad just in case he gets swept up in the fallout
	- [[Fengxian]] writes to him to let him know that the buyout fell through
	- [[Lakan]] expects to be away for only 6 months, but is gone for three years
	- When he returns, he discovers a pile of letters from [[Fengxian]] along with a bloody one paired with a bag of severed fingers, meant to be a curse upon him
		- One finger is a baby's
	- All at once, he realizes that he's been blind to the obvious truth that [[Fengxian]] had become pregnant from the last time they saw each other
	- He rushes to [[Verdigris House]] in the rain and cries to [[Yarite Baba]] where is [[Fengxian]]
		- She hits him, berates him, and yells that [[Fengxian]] is gone
	- Heck dude this hits in the feels
- [[Lakan]] wakes up, [[Verdigris House]]
	- [[Meimei]] is taking care of him
	- He explains that [[Meimei]] used to be [[Fengxian]]'s servant girl
		- He used to play board games with her and when he complemented her, she seemed abashed
			- This resurfaces the notion that [[Meimei]] has a little crush on [[Lakan]]
	- [[Meimei]] brings him something to drink
		- But it's super bitter!
		- [[Maomao]] made it
		- After hearing that [[Maomao]] made it, he's not as offended by it
		- [[Maomao]] has also left a withered blue rose for him
			- "Even when withered, it can retain its shape"
- [[Maomao]] in a carriage with [[Basen]]
	- Presumably headed back to the palace from the [[Verdigris House]]
