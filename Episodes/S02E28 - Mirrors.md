# Plot
- [[Cousin Special Envoys]]
	- #shot from the garden area of a 3-story building (bigger than consort pavilion), but which we haven't seen before
	- #shot The [[Cousin Special Envoys]] are sitting in chairs
		- facing a palace man who is bowing to them
		- four mirrors covered with white cloths
		- [[Ayla]] gets up
	- #shot We see two men staked out. One is at an entrance and one is on a high floor ^bc32cd
	- #shot [[Ayla]] is talking with [[Master Shishou]]
- The mirror
	- [[Jade Pavilion]]
	- There is a new mirror
		- Everyone is impressed
		- It is made out of glass
	- Information on mirrors
		- Glass mirrors are hard to make
		- Only available through trade with the west
		- This mirror must be very valuable
	- The [[Jade Pavilion]] had a glass hand mirror in the past
		- But [[Yinghua]] broke it
	- This mirror was a gift from the special foreign envoy
		- [[Maomao]] recalls the envoy being discussed
			- The [[Caravan]] was the advance party to the arrival of the envoy
		- A mirror was given to each [[High-ranking Concubine]]
			- #shot of each concubine with their new mirror
	- Transporting the four mirrors must have been difficult
- The question of the two sisters
	- #shot of [[Jade Pavilion]] from courtyard. It's lush at this time of year. In some ways, this is a parallel shot to the opening shot of the 3-storied building
	- [[Gaoshun]] comes to the [[Jade Pavilion]] to ask [[Maomao]] to consult on an issue
	- [[Hongnian]] wants to join
		- However, loses interest when she learns that [[Gaoshun]] is married
			- Is [[Hongnian]] looking for a husband?
		- She still joins though?
	- The problem
		- A rich family has two daughters
			- Close in age
			- Similar appearances
		- Loved by their parents
		- When they came of age, parents became overprotective
			- Not allowed to leave house
				- Not even together
			- Lady in waiting monitored them
			- Stayed in the house
		- The lady in waiting felt sympathy for them and took them out a few times
			- But the father found out
		- The father stationed male servants outside the room to watch them
			- The included #shot is reminiscent of ![[S02E28 - Mirrors#^bc32cd]]
			- The second #shot in fact shows the exact courtyard, side building, and [[Three-storied building]] that was shown at the beginning of the episode
		- The father locked the door to their room
		- The daughters were introverts
			- Spent all day at embroidery
		- One day, younger daughter is pregnant
			- Older daughter claims it is the child of a wizard
	- [[Maomao]]'s questions
		- Didn't the lady in waiting just sneak them out?
			- No, she had been fired as a warning
			- There was a new one that didn't interact with them very much
		- Did one of the servant men do it?
			- Not allowed to approach the room
	- [[Maomao]] says it's outside her realm of expertise
		- Notes that it's possible for the body to trick itself into thinking it's pregnant
		- She asks if [[Gaoshun]] is sure she's pregnant
			- [[Gaoshun]] reacts funnily, implying that the story he has told is at least partially fabricated. It is likely a thought experiment constructed around a real mystery involving the [[Cousin Special Envoys]]
			- [[Gaoshun]] clarifies that what he really wants to know is how she snuck past surveillance
	- [[Gaoshun]] even has a diagram of how they were being surveilled
		- ![[Pasted image 20250620221620.png]]
			- What is the square my dude
		- Three ways of leaving the room
			- W-running corridor to main building
			- S window
				- Watched by man on third floor of main building
			- E window
				- Watched by man on first floor of main building
	- More questions
		- Could the guards see inside the room?
			- No, but they could see the sisters doing needlepoint near the window
		- Why were they doing a strange hobby like embroidery?
			- They are from a pastoral culture #huh 
	- [[Maomao]] thinks [[Gaoshun]] is hiding important details
	- [[Gaoshun]] says that [[Jinshi]] is sorry that the [[Ox bezoar]] is late
		- It's suddenly in high demand
			- #why [[Maomao]] doesn't get an answer for this
		- He's been gifted rare medicines by different people recently
			- People know he's looking for them
				- I guess we can assume that part of this is [[Jinshi]] wanting to get these for [[Maomao]], but I'm not sure this explains why the [[Ox bezoar]] is in high demand, unless it's people preemptively buying it so they can try to get favors from [[Jinshi]]
		- [[Gaoshun]] gives her [[Bear gall]] to tide her over
			- [[Jinshi]] had wanted to give it to her personally
				- So it seems that [[Jinshi]] is tied up with some business, perhaps related to the sister problem
	- [[Maomao]]'s Solution
		- A mirror was placed diagonally between the sisters
		- The needlepoint was chosen to be an image that looks like two different things (birds, rabbits) and each girl worked on a mirrored version
		- One girl stayed with the mirror and the other left by the W exit
		- Additionally
			- The mirrors from the envoys were large and had high quality reflections
			- [[Luomen]] said that high-class women in [[The West]] often did needlepoint
			- It seems likely that this is not about a pregnancy, but rather about a guest who may be a spy
- [[Gaoshun]] and [[Jinshi]]
	- "An otherworldly beauty that sheds pearls as tears"
	- [[S02E26 - Caravan#^f886db|High-ranking official in charge of welcoming party]] is asking [[Jinshi]] for help
	- [[Jinshi]] is concerned
		- This concerns the envoys ([[Cousin Special Envoys]])
		- Their mirrors are suspicious
		- This request is also weird
- The otherworldly beauty
	- [[Jade Pavilion]]
	- [[Jinshi]], [[Gaoshun]], [[Gyokuyou]], [[Hongnian]], [[Maomao]]
	- [[Jinshi]] asks [[Maomao]] if she has heard of "An otherworldly beauty that sheds pearls as tears"
	- Story
		- Beauty, like moon fairy
		- Danced
		- Lights danced around her
		- When she cried, her tears turned to pearls
		- Courtesan from [[Pleasure District]]
	- Requested by envoys
		- Envoys from [[The West]]
		- Their grandfather told them the story when they were young
			- The story is around 50 years old
	- The courtesan in question is [[Yarite Baba]]
	- [[Maomao]] says they could just hire a beautiful woman
		- [[Jinshi]] said they already threw a welcoming party with beautiful women, but the envoys were not satisfied
			- #shot of the two envoys in a similar event space that [[Verdigris House]] performed in when [[Jinshi]] found [[Maomao]] dancing for them. 7 men in fez hats accompanying
		- The envoys laughed it off
	- The envoys are female, so they're not interested in sleeping with the women
	- More information
		- The envoys are very important
		- They control both the northern and western trade points
			- The caravan was large because of interest in increasing trade from both nations
	- [[Jinshi]] is stressed
		- Needs a solution that is both effective and isn't risky
			- So no hallucinogens
- [[Yarite Baba]]
	- Visitation room
	- Did she perform for an envoy?
		- Yes
		- >50 years ago
			- Emperor before [[Late Emperor]]
		- At the time, there were tourists visiting the city
			- It had been build on ancient ruins
		- The city was newly the capital of the country
		- There was no castle at the time
		- They used a ruin as the venue
			- Old ceremonial site
			- Next to a pond
			- Buildings next to an orchard
			- [[North ruins]]
		- [[Yarite Baba]] was main dancer
			- She was the highest-ranked courtesan at the time
				- She had 12 backup dancers
			- She was tall and curvy
		- The event was largely improvised and hard to plan
			- They tried to increase visibility
				- Planned for phase of moon
				- Cleared out obstacles
			- Picked out bugs from nearby orchard
				- But there were bugs around torches
		- People tampered with her costume
			- Rubbed bug carcasses on it
			- But she powered through it
		- Audience loved the performance
		- [[Maomao]] has heard this story before
	- [[Yarite Baba]] unpacks a painting of her perfoming
		- It was commissioned by the envoy when he got home
	- [[Maomao]] feels like she's missing what caused the audience to call her a goddess
		- [[Yarite Baba]]'s telling does not seem to be wrong, but it's missing something that the audience experienced
- Updating [[Jinshi]]
	- Still challenging
	- [[Gaoshun]] suggests that they can just find someone who looks like the painting
	- One issue is the height; 175cm tall beautiful women are hard to find
	- Apparently, the envoys are tall and women from [[Empire of Li]] tend to be shorter. [[Gaoshun]] is afraid that short women will be seen as children by the envoys
	- [[Maomao]] is hearing for the first time that there are two envoys
		- They are cousins with the same grandfather
	- [[Maomao]] realizes that they should use [[Jinshi]]
- [[Emperor]] with [[Loulan]]
	- [[Garnet Pavilion]]
	- #shot of the [[Emperor]] sitting across from [[Loulan]], likely an imposter
		- She is dressed in the style seen in later [[S01E20 - Thornapple]]
	- [[Loulan]] giggles
- [[Shisui]]
	- [[North forest]], near the [[North ruins]]
	- [[Shisui]] is digging in a bush with a wooden insect cage next to her
	- She places something in the cage and makes notes in her book
	- She sees a glowing moth flying into the sky and watches it
# Inciting Events
# Places
Where the [[Cousin Special Envoys]] are staying or at least are meeting with [[Master Shishou]]
![[Pasted image 20250620203114.png]]

# Lingering Questions
# Theory
- The room the [[Cousin Special Envoys]] are in at the very beginning of the episode matches the outside guest room.
- They originally had four mirrors in that room, which they gave to the [[High-ranking Concubine]]s soon after
- It's likely that all four mirrors were used to cover up that [[Ayla]] left to meet with [[Master Shishou]] or that she actually left the capital all together. Still unclear what the specific information that [[Gaoshun]] had was, but there must be some reason that he's asking the question.
