# Plot
- 8:39 - Who is this? ![[VS--Vilos-8’39”.png]] If it's the empress dowager, why?
- 8:39 - The emperor has lost 3 children. We can assume one is the child assumed lost from [[Ah-Duo]], but there are two missing that we don't hear about
- 12:09 - [[Shin]] is the one who pushes the flower off the ledge
# Mapping
- 7:53 - we see that, as long as [[Jinshi]] is leaving by the main [[Crystal Pavilion]] gate, which should be on the south, that the [[Crystal Pavilion]] is on the west side of the [[Rear Palace]], since we can see an outer wall to their right. Keep in mind they may have used the N exit, which would flip things. In this episode, [[Maomao]] suggests that there is a part of the [[Rear Palace]] where the [[High-ranking Concubine]]s are concentrated, so having the [[Crystal Pavilion]] on the W would break with that
- 8:00 - The way to the [[Crystal Pavilion]] breaks from the main western corridor by going left then right. Both turns are in front of blank walls
