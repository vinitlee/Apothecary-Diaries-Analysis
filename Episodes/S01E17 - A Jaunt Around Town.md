# Plot
- Makeup

- Maomao makes the makeup
	- She goes all the way and makes a lot of variants
- Application
	- Jinshi is glamorous first thing in the morning
	- Maomao says that his smell will give him away due to the expensive incense
		- She says that brothels tell class of customer by smell
	- Parts of the outfit
		- Unwashed clothes
		- Salt and oil in his hair
		- Fabric scrap as a hair tie
		- Padding to make him look fat
		- Suntan makeup
		- Moles makeup
		- Voice changing syrup
			- Made from irritants
		- Cotton in mouth
- Please go with him
	- Gaoshun and Suiren want her to go with Jinshi
	- She makes excuses
	- They respond by proposing that she go in disguise too
- Town
	- Maomao is dressed as a noble
		- She's wearing Suiren's daughter's dress
	- Jinshi will go by Jinka and pretend to be her servant
	- Jokes about how Jinshi as a woman would make him a Hellen of Troy
	- He's headed to a restaurant just outside of the pleasure district
		- He's meeting an acquaintance
	- Basen is acting as a covert bodyguard
	- Maomao is concerned about Luomen
	- She buys yakitori
		- He says it's better than at camp
			- That's for soldiers, not eunuchs
- Jinshi's toys
	- Gaoshun and Suiren with a box of toys
	- Gaoshun says that Jinshi is pleased
	- This is a coded statement about Gaoshun/Suiren's motives with Jinshi, talking about his relationship with Maomao through the lens of his habits around toys as a child
		- It was a good suggestion from Gaoshun
			- Going out into town with Maomao?
		- When he was a child, when Jinshi found a new favorite toy, he would never let it go
			- This is a clear allusion to his fixation on Maomao
		- If Suiren hid his favorite toy, he would cry like the world was ending
			- It didn't work to just take the toy away
			- This is perhaps a metaphor for the lengths to which he went to bring Maomao back into the palace
		- Gaoshun would try to find young Jinshi a new toy
	- Gaoshun says that Jinshi's position does not allow him to fixate on one thing
	- This scene both strongly hints at Jinshi not being a normal official since Gaoshun and Suiren have been responsible for him since he was a child, but also hints that their feelings about Maomao are not all positive
- Maomao tries to break away
	- Maomao is trying to split with Jinshi
	- He complains and asks if palace life is so bad
		- This is a thinly veiled metaphor for life with him versus life without him
	- She says that she likes palace life but she's worried about her father
	- Maomao talks about Luomen
		- Knows both eastern and western medicine
		- Studied abroad in the west when he was young
		- He must have been chosen by the empire
		- Why is he working in the pleasure district?
		- He is a eunuch
		- He was brought into the rear palace by the [[Late Emperor]]'s mother, who was the empress dowager after studying abroad due to his skill
			- His loss of manhood was a result of his skill
	- Jinshi seems like he recognizes the description of Luomen
- They arrive where Jinshi is headed
	- Maomao recognizes the place where Jinshi is going
		- It's a brothel above a restaurant
		- She says that he could have just gone to the pleasure district
			- She seems mildly upset
	- Jinshi asks whether she knows the regulars at Verdigris House
		- He asks who they are, she says she cannot say due to confidentiality
	- Jinshi asks directly how you would reduce the value of a courtesan
		- Maomao reacts very negatively
		- Says that it's an unpleasant question
		- Describes the process of training and selecting out courtesans
		- Says that only the top skilled get to keep their chastity, but that their value comes from that purity
		- Concludes that a pregnancy would drop their value to nothing
		- This is a direct telling of one side of the [[Lakan's Mistake]] story, and fits with the clues that Lakan had [[S01E16 - Lead#^007674|given]] in the previous episode.
# Lingering Questions
What did Gaoshun suggest? Is it the outing or something else?
Why is Jinshi going to this particular institution? Who is he meeting?
Why does Maomao seem put off by his choice of venue?
Why does Jinshi recognize Luomen's description?
# Subplot and Themes
[[Jinshi's True Identity]]
This is a heavy "Jinshi isn't who he claims to be" episode. It makes sense, given that it's an episode about disguising, but Maomao may not realize that it's a disguise on a disguise
- He is well built
	- Muscles
	- Callouses on hands suggesting swordsmanship
- Why did he attend "camp", which sounds like military camp?
- Why does he need to disguise himself so much?
