# Plot
- Dream sequence
	- Young [[Jinshi]] chasing a bouncing ball
	- Sees [[Late Emperor]] standing in front of him
	- The [[Late Emperor]] smiles at him
		- Goes to offer him something from his hand
	- [[Empr Dow Anshi]] intercedes
		- She has a very serious, negative expression on
	- From the far end of the hall behind the [[Late Emperor]], the [[The Empress]] approaches
		- Flanked by 6 court men
		- [[Late Emperor]] gasps with some fear
		- [[Empr Dow Anshi]] goes into a kneeling bow
			- Young [[Jinshi]] follows suit
		- [[Empr Dow Anshi]] has a weird expression on
			- [[Jinshi]] voiceover wonders why she had that expression
		- Young [[Jinshi]] refers to [[Empr Dow Anshi]] as mother
	- [[The Empress]] puts her hand on [[Late Emperor]]'s shoulder and suggests that he go back to his room
		- He seems frightened, but also not all there
		- He is making grunting noises and gripping himself
	- Two men carry [[Late Emperor]] down the hall, following [[The Empress]]
		- In his right hand is a [[Orpiment]]
	- [[Jinshi]] voiceover asks who [[Late Emperor]] and [[The Empress]] were, just referring to them as old man and old woman
	- [[Late Emperor]] drops the [[Orpiment]]
	- Young [[Jinshi]] reaches out for the [[Orpiment]]
- [[Jinshi]] wakes up
	- It's the middle of the night
	- He starts practicing sword fighting to calm his mind
	- He explains
		- When he was young, he did not know who the [[Late Emperor]] and [[The Empress]] were
		- Later, it was explained that they were his father and grandmother
		- He grew up thinking that [[Emperor]] was his father
			- But was told and currently believes that [[Emperor]] is his older brother
	- He thinks about [[Maomao]]
		- While she can be ignorant of certain things, she is bound to figure out his true identity eventually
		- If she already had, that would put his mind at ease
		- He's having a tough time
- History lesson at [[School]]
	- Lesson ^dbeea6
		- Long time ago, [[Imperial Capital]]/[[Empire of Li]] used to be home to a different ethnicity of people, part of the [[Ancient Civilization]]
		- They had no leader
		- A [[Mother Royal|noble woman]] arrived from a distant land
		- [[Mother Royal]] became pregnant by divine intervention
		- The child of [[Mother Royal]] became the [[First Emperor of Li]]
		- [[Mother Royal]] could see in the dark
		- Became known later as [[Mother Royal]]
		- Some say she was a sorceress from a land of sorcerers
		- This is the myth of the [[Empire of Li]]'s founding
	- [[Jinshi]] has been approaching the school through the lesson
	- [[Maomao]] has been watching the lesson covertly
	- [[Jinshi]] gets to [[Maomao]]
		- Asks how the lesson is going
		- [[Maomao]] scolds him to not distract the students
	- There are apparently around 20 students
		- [[Jinshi]] wants more
		- [[Gaoshun]] says that there were only 10 at first, so it's growing
	- [[Maomao]] reflects on the mission
		- [[Jinshi]] wants to make more girls in the [[Rear Palace]] literate
		- However, that will change the nature of the [[Rear Palace]] considerably
		- [[Xiaolan]] is already able to read simple stories by herself
	- [[Jinshi]] and [[Gaoshun]] have business to attend to and leave
- [[Maomao]] and [[Xiaolan]] after class
	- [[Xiaolan]] has learned some characters, but still has lots to work on
	- She asks the teacher for help
	- The teacher lives in the building next door and [[Xiaolan]] asks him questions there
	- The [[Shrine of Choosing]] is nearby
- Inspecting the [[Shrine of Choosing]]
	- [[Teacher]]'s quarters
	- [[Xiaolan]] is getting help
	- [[Maomao]] is looking out the window, over the pond, at the [[Shrine of Choosing]]
		- The building is thin and long "and goes quite deep"
			- I'm going to assume this just means thin and long
		- Distance between pillars is small, suggesting lots of small rooms
	- [[Teacher]] comes over to the window and tells [[Maomao]] about the [[Shrine of Choosing]] ^bcfeac
		- Built by [[Ancient People]]
			- Before the arrival of [[Mother Royal]] (? This is implied by the next line, but not explicit)
		- [[Mother Royal]] did not denounce old religion of [[Ancient Civilization]]
			- Which this [[Shrine of Choosing]] was a shrine to
		- According to legend, [[Mother Royal]] told her son that
			- "The one who rules this land must pass through that shrine."
			- "Only those who choose the right path can be the ruler of this land."
		- The son, [[First Emperor of Li]], passed through the shrine
		- The capital city was moved to [[Imperial Capital]] because it was where the [[Shrine of Choosing]] was located #whoa 
			- This was during [[-2 Emperor]]
		- [[Shrine of Choosing]] has not been used in many decades
			- [[Late Emperor]] had older brothers who died in an epidemic, only he survived. So there was no choice other than him.
		- So, traditionally, [[Shrine of Choosing]] would be used to determine heir rather than solely birth order
	- [[Teacher]] expresses happiness that [[Maomao]] is interested in the [[Shrine of Choosing]]
		- It's been neglected
		- [[Luomen]] used to wander near the [[Shrine of Choosing]]
	- It seems that [[Teacher]] used to know [[Luomen]]
	- [[Xiaolan]] interrupts to show her writing
- [[Jade Pavilion]]
	- [[Maomao]] is finishing tasting for [[Gyokuyou]] and [[Emperor]]
	- Before she leaves, [[Emperor]] tells her that he wants her to accompany him somewhere after the meal
	- He's going to the [[Shrine of Choosing]]
- Walking over
	- [[Emperor]], 2 eunuchs, [[Maomao]], [[Jinshi]], [[Gaoshun]]
	- Walking through [[Ruined Orchard]] at night
	- [[Jinshi]] questions why [[Emperor]] is suddenly doing this
		- [[Emperor]] does not answer
		- [[Maomao]] wonders what his intent is
	- The [[Shrine of Choosing]] is the same shrine-like building she has seen a few times and was talking to [[Teacher]] about before
	- [[Teacher]] is standing in front of the doorway
		- Greets them, seems to be responsible for [[Shrine of Choosing]]
	- [[Emperor]] asks to do the challenge again
		- So he's done it before and failed
		- [[Teacher]] says that the result may be the same, but he's welcome to give it a shot
		- This is a very informal way of addressing the [[Emperor]] #whoa 
	- [[Teacher]] asks [[Emperor]] who is going with him
		- [[Emperor]] is bringing [[Jinshi]] and [[Maomao]]
		- [[Maomao]] thinks it's off limits to women
			- It's not
			- [[Mother Royal]] was a woman
			- But also [[Empr Dow Anshi]] apparently also went through the shrine?
				- I wonder if this is a mistranslation of [[The Empress]]
- [[Shrine of Choosing]], [[Emperor]]'s attempt
	- [[Emperor]] is mostly just guessing, like choosing the green door because he chose the blue door last time
	- [[Teacher]] presses [[Emperor]] to be more considerate of the ones upkeeping [[Shrine of Choosing]], since this use was on short notice
	- [[Maomao]] feels like [[Emperor]]'s attempt is a little aimless
	- The [[Shrine of Choosing]] is mazelike and the initial path goes back and forth and up and down
	- There is a final room with two entrance doors
	- [[Emperor]] chooses yellow door
		- Leads to dead end, *Child of royalty, yet not child of the Mother Royal*
		- Same result as last attempt
		- [[Emperor]] feels that this means that he cannot "decipher the heavens"
	- [[Teacher]] humbly protests (seemingly out of politeness)
		- [[Emperor]] was responsible for including [[Shrine of Choosing]] into the rear palace #huh 
			- It may just be "you" = the imperial family
		- [[Teacher]] is the only person managing [[Shrine of Choosing]]
			- [[Maomao]] figures that he must have been managing the [[Shrine of Choosing]] from before the movement of the capital and the building of the palace, especially [[Rear Palace]], which would have been well within the last 50 years
			- Therefore, he must have accepted castration in order to continue tending to the [[Shrine of Choosing]]
		- [[Teacher]] suggests that the fact that the [[Shrine of Choosing]] has been so neglected must mean that it's not important
			- This is both a politeness to the [[Emperor]] and a jab
	- They leave by the exit and emerge at the entrance of the [[Shrine of Choosing]]
- [[Maomao]] starts analyzing
	- [[Emperor]] followed the rules as written
	- But still failed
	- There must be a greater intent
	- Does something else factor in
		- Color of doors
		- Number of rooms
	- [[Teacher]] remarks that [[Luomen]] would have figured it out
		- In his style, this is a double entendre; it is part a jab and part a clue
		- [[Maomao]] feels a little insulted
		- But also considers that [[Luomen]]'s specialty is specifically in medicine
			- And also he studied in [[The West]]
	- *Child of royalty, yet not child of the Mother Royal*
		- Does this phrase have a deeper meaning to it
		- [[Mother Royal]] appears in the foundation myth, but not a royal father
			- One would assume that [[Empire of Li]] would therefore have a maternal lineage system, but it has a paternal one
		- So, perhaps there's a method to maintain maternal lineage in the background
	- [[Maomao]] asks if [[Late Emperor]]'s older brothers were to the same mother
		- They were born to sisters
			- So therefore similar genetics
	- [[Maomao]] requests to speak frankly
	- Asks [[Emperor]] if previous emperors had poor eyesight
	- [[Teacher]] seems amazed that she figured it out
	- Many previous emperors had poor eyesight, but [[Late Emperor]] had fine eyesight
		- This confirms [[Maomao]]'s suspicions
	- [[Maomao]] requests to do the [[Shrine of Choosing]] again
		- [[Teacher]] is reluctant, but in that double-meaning way
			- Allowed [[Maomao]] to enter last time
			- But doesn't like the idea of a lot of attempts
			- [[Maomao]] is neither a princess nor concubine
				- [[Emperor]] says that he could accept her as a concubine
				- But [[Lakan]] would have issues
				- [[Jinshi]] and [[Maomao]] both question this, [[Jinshi]] out loud
	- [[Emperor]] laughs and suggests that [[Jinshi]] take her
		- This is interesting given the setup and current understanding of the places of everyone here
		- [[Jinshi]] is believed to be the younger brother of [[Emperor]], so by the traditional method of [[Shrine of Choosing]], if he were able to pass the test he should be the rightful heir
		- Potential heirs are allowed to have the aide of a concubine or princess in the [[Shrine of Choosing]], even if they are unable to pass it alone. This is loosely placing [[Maomao]] in that position and [[Maomao-Jinshi Romance]] plays in
- [[Maomao]]'s attempt
	- See [[Shrine of Choosing#^b926ba|Maomao's attempt]]
	- She seems pretty confident and chooses some doors that the [[Emperor]] had not
	- At the final room, when prompted to choose the red door, [[Maomao]] chooses a green one
		- She seems to know that this is the end
	- This leads out to an outlook high up in the [[Shrine of Choosing]] overlooking the entire palace
- At the end of the [[Shrine of Choosing]]
	- [[Teacher]] explains
		- In the past, successful emperors would stand at this spot and make a proclamation to the people
		- If no heirs could succeed on their own, they could retake the test with a concubine choosing the path
		- That would have been done by either heirs or concubines with the right lineage, but [[Maomao]] circumvented that with reasoning
	- [[Emperor]] asks for an explanation
		- [[Teacher]] foists the explanation onto [[Maomao]]
	- [[Maomao]]'s explanation
		- [[Mother Royal]] said to have seen in the dark
		- Her descendants have trouble telling colors apart
		- Specifically, red-green colorblindness
		- Colorblindness is rare in [[Empire of Li]], but is more common in [[The West]] or [[The West of Li]] or [[Western Region]]
			- 1/10 males are red-green colorblind there
		- [[Luomen]] would have figured it out because he studied medicine in [[The West]]
		- Explains per-door
		- [[Emperor]] thinks that this would have been noticed
			- They get used to it and it doesn't come up a lot
			- #huh But didn't he just say before that they had poor eyesight?
		- Colorblindness also leads to better night vision
		- [[Maomao]] figures that there is a low probability of making it through most of the rooms on chance (1/512), but the last room would be especially challenging for someone without colorblindness to pass. The previous rooms all had two apparent right answers, but the last room has 0 apparent correct answers
		- Reality of the legend
			- [[Mother Royal]] came from [[The West]]
				- We see camels and clothes somewhat similar to [[Cousin Special Envoys]]
			- Came with many servants
			- Married into the existing royalty
				- Covered that up strategically
				- Common to bring outsider into bloodline to stop inbreeding
				- Male hereditary bloodline to honor original marriage into the  royalty
			- [[Mother Royal]] wanted to protect her bloodline and set up the [[Shrine of Choosing]] to do so
				- If the current male heirs could not complete, concubines from the [[Mother Royal]] family would be brought in
					- #hm by who? This suggests some sort of Bene Gesserit force that is able to find and place concubines from the [[Mother Royal]] bloodline. What is interesting as well is that we may be seeing this already in the [[Cousin Special Envoys]], especially considering that they were interested in both [[Emperor]] and his brother
			- This lead to power consolidation into a shadow force that eventually got rid of the original male ruler from the story
				- "Very peaceful, very deliberate takeover"
	- [[Emperor]] asks if this means that he does not have [[Mother Royal]] blood
		- [[Maomao]] says that [[Shrine of Choosing]] is just the most accurate way of finding out
		- But that the trait is not always passed on, so [[Emperor]] may still be in the bloodline
	- [[Maomao]] also says that bloodlines that are too thick can be problematic, it's not necessarily good to keep the same trait because it indicates inbreeding
		- She suspects that [[Late Emperor]]'s older brothers may have succumbed to the epidemic because of this inbreeding
	- [[Teacher]] congratulates [[Maomao]] for figuring it out
		- He knew!
		- [[Mother Royal]] ruled over the land because she was smart
			- He suggests adding [[Maomao]] to the bloodline because she is also smart
				- This, again, is somewhat a double meaning by both being not serious while also reflecting the very real fact that [[Maomao]] has shot up in position since 2 years back due to her being an asset
	- [[Emperor]] jokes that it's an interesting suggestion but
		- [[Lakan]] would be unhappy
		- She's not busty enough
	- #hm [[Teacher]] warns the [[Emperor]], but perhaps also [[Jinshi]]
		- Be careful
		- Many people do not like the addition of new blood into the royal bloodline
			- [[Emperor]] says he's aware
				- [[Teacher]] says that he must be
					- Why must he be?
					- [[Gyokuyou]]?
					- Just his position?
		- However, [[Teacher]] seems to maybe not been talking to [[Emperor]], since he seems to brush off [[Emperor]]'s response and bow again, more towards [[Jinshi]],  and repeat to be careful
			- [[Jinshi]] says that he knows
- Returning from [[Shrine of Choosing]]
	- [[Gaoshun]] and two eunuchs are waiting for them
	- [[Maomao]] wonders who [[Jinshi]] actually is
		- How is she this dense
	- She ends up shelving the thought, with the feeling that there are some things best left unknown
		- I think this is meant to be a thematic callback to the figured truth of [[Mother Royal]] as another thing that is best left unknown to [[Emperor]]
